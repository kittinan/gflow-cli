Built and live-verified 2026-09-05 (`docs/LIVE_VERIFICATION_v0.67.0.md`, recon
`docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-09-05-migrated-host-wire-protocol.md`). Each of these
cost a real run to learn; each is now a unit test in `tests/api/transports/`.

- **Record slots:** in the shared `YhhmEf`/`jwpduf`/`as29s` record, `DETAILS[10]` is the
  **poster JPEG** signed URL and `MEDIA_INFO[0][8]` is the **mp4** — the first build
  had them swapped and downloaded a 37 KB JPEG named `.mp4`. `download()` now checks
  `ftyp` at offset 4 and falls back to the other URL; never trust the slot alone.
- **Status 3 arrives before the URL:** the app's `jwpduf` poll reports 3 first; the
  record with the signed URLs (`as29s`) follows 2–8 s later. Treating the first 3 as
  terminal loses the URL — wait a grace (20 s) for the URL-carrying record.
- **Labs redirect route is dead for migrated media:** `media.getMediaUrlRedirect?name=<id>`
  answers **404** for a migrated media id — the signed CDN URL (`flow-content.google`,
  `KeyName=labs-flow-prod-cdn-key`) is the download path; the host is in the allowlist.
- **`:text-matches('^\s*8s\s*$')` is silently wrong:** Playwright's CSS string escaping
  turns `\s` into `s`. Use `locator.filter(has_text=re.compile(...))`; ligature anchors
  (`mat-icon:text-is('videocam')`) carry no backslash and are fine.
- **Composer is the `contenteditable`,** the sibling `textarea` times out on click.
- **Direct load works for everyone:** `https://flow.google.com/project/<id>` served the
  Angular editor to the UNFLAGGED `denon82` (pt) account too — the new host IS the
  default (since #664's round-7 commit) for every request it can serve — t2v with a project —
  on moved and unmoved accounts alike under `auto`; `flow.google.com` forces everything,
  `labs.google` is the kill switch. denon82 itself moved on 2026-09-05.
- **The settings pane is not `.cdk-overlay-pane.last`** (#665): after the model menu — a second
  overlay — opens and closes, a detached menu pane can still be the LAST overlay, so every axis
  after `--model` read "0 option groups". Resolve the pane as the overlay that CONTAINS a
  `[role='radiogroup']`; the fake page keeps a stale menu pane as `.last` so the regression
  cannot pass vacuously. Found by the $0 #650 check, not by any test.
- **Dispatch timing:** on a flagged account the bootstrap page has already hopped when
  `_generate_video_locked` starts (`migrated.dispatch` at ~6.8 s), so the composer is
  chosen BEFORE any labs project entry; the after-entry check exists for the case where
  the hop lands during project navigation.
- **Session hook + heredoc apostrophes, reconfirmed:** a bash heredoc whose body carries
  apostrophes in prose fails with "unexpected EOF while looking for matching quote" —
  write edit scripts to a file with the Write tool and run them.
