"""Drive Flow's migrated ``flow.google.com`` editor (Angular Material) — t2v, and i2v
from a local start frame.

Google is moving accounts from ``labs.google/fx/tools/flow`` onto
``flow.google.com`` (issue #639). The migrated app is the same product on a
different widget toolkit: ligatures live in ``<mat-icon>`` instead of ``<i>``,
the settings popover is a ``cdk-overlay`` pane of ``[role=radiogroup]`` /
``[role=radio]`` buttons instead of ``role=menu`` tabs, the model picker is a
``[role=menu]`` of ``[role=menuitem]``s, and the composer is a ``contenteditable``
(the ``textarea`` next to it is not clickable). On the wire it is ``batchexecute``,
not aisandbox REST: submit is rpcid ``YhhmEf`` (t2v) or ``eb1hJf`` (i2v), the app
then polls ``jwpduf`` every 5 s by itself and fetches the result with ``as29s`` — so
this driver **observes** the page's own traffic and adds none. A start frame goes in
through the editor's own upload (``maseQ``) and its library picker. Recon with
measurements: ``docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-09-05-migrated-host-wire-protocol.md``
and ``docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-09-05-migrated-frames-attach.md``.

Every anchor here is structural or a Material Symbols ligature; the only text
matched is a numeric token (``8s``, ``x2``) or a product name (``Veo 3.1 - Lite``).
``aria-label`` values are translated on this host and are never used.

Selector trap recorded by the spike: Playwright's CSS ``:text-matches('\\s…')``
goes through CSS string escaping, which turns ``\\s`` into ``s`` — labels are
matched with a Python-side ``filter(has_text=re.compile(...))`` instead.

        where an exception is already in flight, so a close failure cannot mask the
        error the caller actually needs — see :meth:`apply_video_settings`.

        One Escape is not enough after ``--model``. Selecting from the menu leaves
        Angular with **two** stacked overlays — the settings pane and the menu opened
        over it — and each Escape dismisses exactly one, so a single press closed only
        the menu and left the settings pane covering the composer. ``send_prompt``'s
        click then failed Playwright's actionability check and surfaced ~5 s later as a
        bare ``TimeoutError`` naming ``[contenteditable='true']``, with nothing pointing
        at the pane. Field-reported as "switch the model and the run dies; re-run with
        the same model and it works" — a re-run binds the model at the button read-back,
        never opens the menu, and so never stacks the second overlay.

        Measured 2026-09-05 at $0 (spike
        ``2026-09-05-migrated-model-menu-lower-priority.md``): after a switch the
        composer's bounding box is **identical** for 12 s — it was never unstable — while
        ``.cdk-overlay-pane:visible`` stays at 1; one more Escape takes it to 0 and the
        prompt types.

        The old read-back *did* notice — ``migrated.pane_still_open`` fires on the
        pre-fix source, confirmed by replaying it against the live host. It was a
        warning: the run continued, the composer click timed out 5 s later, and the
        error it raised named ``[contenteditable='true']`` with no reference to the
        warning that had predicted it. The observation was there and only the
        consequence was missing, so it is now the failure itself.

        A pane that will not close is raised here, pre-submit and at $0, rather than left
        for the composer click to report as an unattributable timeout.
