Feature: image-to-video on the migrated flow.google.com host
  On the new host a start frame is an in-project asset. gflow uploads the local file
  through the editor's own Upload entry, observes the app's maseQ reply for the media id,
  binds it through the Start-frame picker by that name, and asserts the eb1hJf submit
  body carries that id before treating the run as an i2v generation.

  What is uploaded is a RUN-UNIQUE COPY of the local file (#792): the picker is searched
  by display name, so two runs of one file would otherwise leave two identical entries
  and the search could bind the stale one.

  Scenario: a moved account generates from a local start frame
    Given the editor hands the session to flow.google.com after entering the project
    And the library already lists an older "hero.png"
    And a local start frame "hero.png"
    When gflow video i2v runs with an 8 s request
    Then the composer uploads the file and the maseQ reply names a media id
    And the Start chip binds the asset uploaded from "hero.png"
    And the eb1hJf submit body carries that media id and an i2v model key
    And the result reports success with the workflow id

  Scenario: the picker waits for its own confirm before committing the pick
    Given the picker does not commit on the option click
    When gflow video i2v runs with an 8 s request
    Then the picker's confirm is clicked and the Start chip binds

  Scenario: the picker neither commits nor offers a confirm
    Given the picker does not commit on the option click
    And the picker offers no confirm
    When gflow video i2v runs with an 8 s request
    Then the run fails with exit 23 naming the missing confirm

  Scenario: the frame did not bind, so nothing is submitted
    Given the library never lists the upload
    When gflow video i2v runs with an 8 s request
    Then the run fails with exit 32 before any submit
    And the detail names the file and the picker

  Scenario: the app submitted a text-to-video body for an i2v request
    Given the Start chip is bound
    And the submit reply arrives on YhhmEf with a t2v model key
    When gflow video i2v runs with an 8 s request
    Then the run fails with exit 7 naming the t2v key on an i2v request

  Scenario: the upload is rejected
    Given maseQ answers 400
    When gflow video i2v runs with an 8 s request
    Then the run fails with exit 27 naming route batchexecute:maseQ
    And no submit was clicked

  Scenario: a moved account routes local start and end frames to the migrated host
    Given the editor hands the session to flow.google.com after entering the project
    When gflow video i2v runs with a local start frame and a local end frame
    Then the migrated host takes the run, not the labs driver

  Scenario: an unmoved account with local start and end frames reaches the migrated host
    Given the account has not been moved and a project is given
    When gflow video i2v runs with a local start frame and a local end frame
    Then the migrated host takes the run, not the labs driver
