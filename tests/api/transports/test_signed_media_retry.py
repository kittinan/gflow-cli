"""A transient reset must not discard a clip Flow already generated and billed (#895).

The fault these tests inject is real, not imagined: `E4
<../../../docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-09-22-playwright-max-retries-econnreset.md>`_
measured ``APIRequestContext.get(max_retries=2)`` against a socket emitting a TCP RST and
showed (a) it retries ``ECONNRESET``, (b) a control with ``max_retries=0`` fails on the
same fault, and (c) all attempts share **one** timeout budget — so three attempts on our
180 s download stay inside ~180 s rather than stretching to nine minutes.

That is why these tests assert the *argument* rather than re-testing Playwright's retry
loop: the driver's behaviour is measured in the spike, and what can regress here is our
call dropping the argument or our error handling losing the clip.
