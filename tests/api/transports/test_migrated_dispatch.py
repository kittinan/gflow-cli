"""Where the migrated composer is chosen (Task 5 of the migrated-host-driver plan).

`_generate_video_locked` decides the route twice: before entering the project
(the bootstrap page may already have hopped, or the host is forced) and after
(the hop is a client-side navigation the labs app performs once the project page
has loaded). `labs.google` as the setting is the kill switch — a moved account
keeps exit 36 exactly as before the driver existed.
