"""#799's agent-only cohort, discriminated against a real CSS engine.

The whole fix turns on one piece of third-party behaviour: whether Playwright reports
a `<button hidden="">` as present-but-not-visible. If it reported it visible, the
readiness gate would never have failed and none of this code would run; if it reported
it absent, the guard would fall through to selector drift and #799 would be unchanged.
A fake answers whatever it was written to answer, so it cannot settle that — only a
real browser can, and AGENTS.md asks for exactly this before wiring in an assumption
about someone else's runtime.

Provenance, precisely: the reporter's issue posts an elided `<button hidden="" ...
aria-label="Settings trigger" class="... settings-trigger-button ...">`, and those
attributes are theirs verbatim. The surrounding component chain
(`flow-creative-agent-prompt-box`, `agent-footer-actions`) comes from the #749 spike
that measured this host. That is not circular — neither selector under test touches
any of it; only the `hidden` attribute and the two class names are load-bearing.

What this does NOT prove is that Flow still serves it; that needs an account in that
cohort, which is a named external blocker on #799. It proves the discriminator is
sound on the DOM we were given, and that its negative controls do not fire.

Two of those controls were also measured against LIVE Flow at $0 (council D6), since
synthetic markup is not the live arm:

* healthy migrated composer (`ffroliva`, a real project page) — trigger present and
  visible, `button.agent-mode-chip` present and **un-pressed**, verdict `False`. This
  is the load-bearing one: a normal account on this host HAS a chip, so having none
  is genuinely anomalous rather than merely unmatched.
* live `/about` landing (`denon82`, #756) — trigger absent, verdict `False`, i.e. the
  `TRIGGER_GONE` arm reached on a real page rather than a written one.

No account, no network, no credits; skips when Chromium is absent.
