"""MCP↔CLI parity contract (AGENTS.md "MCP & CLI Schema Symmetry").

Every CLI leaf command must carry an explicit MCP decision: either it maps to
a registered MCP tool (``CLI_TO_MCP``) or it is deliberately exempt with a
stated reason (``_MCP_EXEMPT``). A new CLI command with neither entry fails
``test_every_cli_leaf_has_an_mcp_decision`` — forcing the parity decision at
review time instead of letting the surfaces drift apart silently
(2026-07-09 skills-audit council, Task 6).

Note on ``gflow_generate_video`` and instructions: unlike the image path, the
video pipeline (``GenerateVideoRequest`` / the worker's ``_build_video_request``)
has no instructions support — agentic-video is a deliberate typed divergence
(``drivers/agentic.py`` raises ``FlowAgentUiError``). An ``instructions`` param
on the video tool would be silently dropped, so it is intentionally absent.

Note on ``--output``/``-o`` (#411): mirrored since the wiring landed — both
generate tools accept ``output`` (``tools.py``) and put ``output_file`` in the
task payload, which the daemon decodes and relocates the artifact to
(``worker/daemon.py``). A v0.48.0 pre-release audit removed an earlier dead
param that the queue never read; the docstring here claimed that state long
after the real wiring shipped (#495).

Note on ``--avatar`` / the ``image avatar`` + ``video avatar`` leaves: both
leaves are EXEMPT, and ``video r2v --avatar`` is intentionally NOT mirrored on
``gflow_generate_video``. Flow's Avatar is verified-identity AND region gated
(``likeness:checkEligibility`` answers ``["REGION"]`` on this project's own
accounts, docs/CHARACTER.md), so the capability could not be exercised
end-to-end before shipping. Exposing an unverified, region-gated,
credit-spending path on the agent-facing surface — where a model calls it
speculatively rather than a human typing it deliberately — is the wrong
default; the CLI keeps it behind an explicit human invocation until a live run
confirms the attach. The upgrade path is mechanical when that happens: add
``avatar: bool`` to ``gflow_generate_video``/``gflow_generate_image``, thread
``use_avatar`` through ``_build_video_payload`` (the worker codec already
decodes it), add ``"avatar"`` to the daemon's video task-type branch, and move
these two leaves into ``CLI_TO_MCP``. ``--no-spend`` needs no work either way:
it removes both generate tools from the registry wholesale.

Note on ``image t2i --jitter`` (#241): intentionally NOT mirrored on
``gflow_generate_image``. The jitter paces submissions *between prompts* in a
multi-prompt run; the MCP tool is single-prompt, so the parameter would be a
silent no-op there. An MCP agent composing several calls owns its own cadence
(or sets ``GFLOW_CLI_JITTER_RANGE`` server-side, which the batch paths honour).

    #     would block an MCP client's tool call past its timeout — the exact
    #     hazard issue #481 exists to address.
    #  2. The feature has an open defect (a 7s segment padded into an 8s slot
    #     produces a frozen, silent second at each internal seam — KNOWN_ISSUES).
    #     Widening the surface before that is settled multiplies the blast radius.

    #     MCP equivalent; an agent could not give informed consent on the user's
