# Usage

CLI command reference. For environment variables see [CONFIGURATION](CONFIGURATION.md). For auth see [AUTHENTICATION](AUTHENTICATION.md).

> ⚠️ **Status.** `gflow video` commands are fully wired as of v0.2.0a1. `gflow image` commands (`upload`, `t2i`, `i2i`) are wired as of v0.3.0a1. **v0.4.0a2** added per-class exit codes (3–7) for shell branching, JSON-on-pipe structured logs (`GFLOW_CLI_LOG_FORMAT=json`), per-worker batch concurrency (`GFLOW_CLI_CONCURRENCY=N`), and tenacity-driven retry/backoff on transient failures.

Global flags:

- `-V`, `--version` — print version and exit.
- `-v`, `--verbose` — log at DEBUG level.

Machine-readable output: the generation commands (`image t2i` / `image i2i` /
`image avatar`, `video t2v` / `i2v` / `r2v` / `avatar`), `auth list`, and
`gflow models` accept `--json` to
emit a single parseable object on stdout instead of Rich tables. See
[§ JSON output](#json-output---json).

Note: `--profile NAME` is **per-subcommand**, not global — pass it after the subcommand name (e.g. `gflow image t2i "..." --profile experiments`, not `gflow --profile experiments image t2i ...`).

## `gflow auth`

See [AUTHENTICATION § Commands](AUTHENTICATION.md#commands).

## `gflow image upload`

Upload a local PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF into a fresh Flow project and print the asset UUID + dimensions Flow inferred. The UUID is what later subcommands (`gflow image i2i --ref UUID`, `video i2v`) accept as an initial frame. Note for `video i2v`: the UUID is preferentially selected from the generation project's media picker, and `upload` puts the asset in a *fresh scratch project* — pass `--project <id>` of the project that holds the asset to select it in place. Since v0.58.0 (#529) a picker miss falls back to re-uploading the catalog's recorded local file (integrity-verified); exit 9 now only occurs when neither the tile nor a verified local file is available.

```text
gflow image upload PATH [OPTIONS]

Arguments:
  PATH                      Local image file (PNG, JPEG, WebP, or GIF). [required]

Options:
  --profile NAME            Profile name (overrides default).
```

The uploader **validates the file's magic bytes** (PNG `\x89PNG`, JPEG `\xff\xd8\xff`, WebP `RIFF...WEBP`, or GIF87a/89a) before calling Flow — anything else is rejected client-side. There is also a hard **20 MB size cap** to match Flow's documented per-file limit; oversize files fail fast without burning a network round-trip.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Upload and read the printed UUID
gflow image upload hero.png

# Pick a profile explicitly
gflow image upload ./shots/01.jpg --profile experiments
```

Output (truncated):

```text
Asset UUID: ddb6ef97-262d-49f4-8269-4a28c0fae6a2
Dimensions: 1024 x 1024  Project: <project-id>
```

Capture the UUID into a shell variable to chain into `i2i` or `video i2v`:

```bash
UUID=$(gflow image upload hero.png | awk '/Asset UUID:/ {print $3}')
gflow image i2i "make it cinematic" --ref "$UUID"
```

## `gflow image upscale`

Upscale a **platform-generated** image to 2K or 4K (the same 1K/2K/4K options Flow's
download menu offers) and save it locally. Uploaded images are not supported.

```text
gflow image upscale MEDIA_ID --scale 2k|4k [OPTIONS]

Arguments:
  MEDIA_ID                  UUID of a Flow-generated image (find one with
                            `gflow data list images`).

Options:
  --scale [2k|4k]           Target resolution. 4k requires a Flow Ultra
                            subscription; 1k is the original (no upscale).
  --project ID              Project that owns the image. Resolved from the local
                            catalog when omitted; pass it explicitly for images
                            gflow didn't record (e.g. generated in the web UI).
  --out PATH                Output directory (see "Output paths" below).
  --profile NAME            Profile name (overrides default).
```

```bash
# Upscale a previously generated image to 2K (project auto-resolved from the catalog)
gflow image upscale 3a56bb5e-92a2-44f4-9992-3c6a9bf0cd14 --scale 2k

# Upscale an image generated in the Flow web UI (not in the local catalog)
gflow image upscale <mediaId> --scale 2k --project <projectId>
```

Notes:

- **Credit-free** — upscaling is an image operation and spends no credits.
- **4K is Ultra-only.** On a non-Ultra account a 4K request fails with exit code 22
  (`UpscaleUnavailableError`) and a hint to use `--scale 2k` or upgrade.
- The result is saved as `<output_dir>/images/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<mediaId>_<scale>.<ext>`
  (extension matches the returned format — usually `.jpg`).

## `gflow image t2i`

Generate 1–4 images from one text prompt, or run a shell-friendly batch of 1–50
prompts through one Flow session/project.

```text
gflow image t2i PROMPT [PROMPT ...] [OPTIONS]
gflow image t2i --prompts-file FILE [OPTIONS]
gflow image t2i --stdin [OPTIONS]

Arguments:
  PROMPT                    Text prompt. Repeat for multi-prompt mode.

Options:
  --prompts-file FILE       UTF-8 text file: one prompt per non-empty line;
                            whole-line # comments skipped.
  --stdin                   Read prompts from stdin using the same format.
  --continue-on-error /
  --fail-fast               Continue after per-prompt failures or stop at the
                            first failed prompt. [default: continue-on-error]
  --jitter SPEC             Anti-bot pause between multi-prompt submissions:
                            'MIN-MAX' seconds, a single number for 0-N, or 0
                            to disable. Widen (e.g. 10-30) if runs hit WAF
                            403s. [default: 0.5-1.5; GFLOW_CLI_JITTER_RANGE
                            overrides the default]
  --model [nano2|nano-pro|image4]
                            Image model alias.                [default: nano2]
  --aspect [9:16|16:9|1:1|4:3|3:4]
                            Aspect ratio.                     [default: 9:16]
  -n, --count INTEGER       How many images to generate (1-4).  [default: 1]
  --out PATH                Output directory (see "Output paths" below).
  --project ID              Generate in this EXISTING Flow project instead of a
                            scratch project. Required to reference locked
                            entities/assets in that project. Single-prompt only.
  -o, --output PATH         Explicit destination file path for the generated asset
                            (e.g., `./out/bird.png`). Overrides automatic filename.
  --reference-entity ID     Flow CHARACTER entity id to reference for character
                            consistency (repeatable; must live in --project).
                            Single-prompt only.
  --reference-entity-name N Display name paired with --reference-entity.
  -t, --tool NAME[:k=v]     Apply a prompt tool before generating, e.g.
                            `creative-director:style=cinema`. Repeatable; applied
                            per prompt on multi-prompt/batch. See "Prompt tools".
  --ui-mode [auto|classic|agentic]
                            Require a Flow UI arm: classic (hard aspect
                            controls) / agentic (chat surface; forced by -i) /
                            auto (default) — auto resolves to classic, the only
                            arm that can satisfy an image request (#595).
                            Aborts exit 28 if unreachable.
                            Single-prompt only; batch uses GFLOW_CLI_UI_MODE.
  --profile NAME            Profile name (overrides default).
```

**Models:**

| Alias | Backing model | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `nano2` | Nano Banana 2 (`NARWHAL`) | Default. Fast, balanced quality. |
| `nano-pro` | Nano Banana Pro (`GEM_PIX_2`) | Higher quality, slower. |
| `image4` | Imagen 4 (`IMAGEN_3_5`) | Photoreal-leaning Imagen variant. |

**Multi-prompt shortcut.**

- Positional multi-prompt: `gflow image t2i "p1" "p2" "p3"`.
- `--prompts-file FILE`: UTF-8 text, one prompt per non-empty line, whole-line
  `#` comments skipped.
- `--stdin`: same format as `--prompts-file`.
- Sources are mutually exclusive.
- Output names use `prompt_<prompt-index>_<variation-index>.png`.
- With `-n 4`, each prompt produces four images; the maximum shell shortcut
  fan-out is 50 prompts * 4 = 200 images.
- `--continue-on-error` is default; `--fail-fast` stops after the first failed
  prompt.

**Prompt tools (`-t` / `--tool`).**

A *tool* is a named, single-purpose transform applied to your prompt before generating —
the first built-in is `creative-director`, which rewrites a terse prompt into a richer one
using Google's five-component formula (Subject + Action + Context/Location +
Composition/Camera + Style) via the public Gemini API. `-t/--tool` is **repeatable** and
works on every generation command (`image t2i`/`i2i`/`batch`, `video t2v`/`i2v`/`r2v`/`chain`);
on multi-prompt/batch it is applied per prompt.

- Requires an OpenAI-compatible endpoint: `GFLOW_CLI_LLM_API_KEY` ([Google key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)) and/or `GFLOW_CLI_LLM_BASE_URL`.
  The model is set per tool via the TOML `config.model` key (default `gemini-2.5-flash`).
- Graceful: if the key is unset or the API errors, gflow prints a notice and
  generates from your **original** prompt — the run never fails because of a tool
  (each call is bounded by an overall ~60s wall-clock budget).
- The local catalog records **both** the original prompt and the submitted
  expansion (withheld under `GFLOW_CLI_HISTORY_PROMPTS=redacted`), plus a
  `metadata_json.tool` provenance descriptor.
- Discover and preview tools with `gflow tools list` / `show` / `run` (see the
  **`gflow tools`** section below). Full reference: [TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md) and
  [PROMPT_EXPANSION.md](PROMPT_EXPANSION.md).

```bash
# Rewrite "cat in space" into a detailed prompt with the cinema style, then generate
gflow image t2i "cat in space" --tool creative-director:style=cinema
```

**Output paths.**

- **Explicit File (`-o` / `--output PATH`).** Saves the generated asset directly to `PATH` (e.g. `-o ./assets/hero.png`). Parent directories are created automatically if they do not exist. With `--count > 1`, images are written as `PATH`'s stem plus `_1`, `_2`, … before the extension (`-o hero.png --count 2` → `hero_1.png`, `hero_2.png`); video commands write a single file only. `-o` is **single-prompt only** (multi-prompt runs abort with a usage error — use `--out` there) and takes precedence over `--out` when both are passed. The path is a **local filesystem path**; it does not accept `s3://`/`gs://` URLs (cloud output still goes through `GFLOW_CLI_STORAGE_URI`).
- **Default (`--out` omitted).** Files land under `$GFLOW_CLI_OUTPUT_DIR/images/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<media_name>_<n>.png`. The date partition keeps long-running batches navigable.
- **Directory (`--out DIR`).** Files are written flat as `<DIR>/<media_name>_<n>.png` — no date subdirectory.
- **Multi-prompt mode.** Files are written as `prompt_<prompt-index>_<variation-index>.png`; the prompt index and variation index are zero-based.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Single image, default model + 9:16 aspect
gflow image t2i "a serene mountain lake at dawn"

# 16:9 with the higher-quality model
gflow image t2i "neon cyberpunk alley" --model nano-pro --aspect 16:9

# 4 variations of a logo at 1:1, written flat into ./logos/
gflow image t2i "variations of a minimalist fox logo" -n 4 --aspect 1:1 --out ./logos

# Three prompts in one warm Flow session/project
gflow image t2i "p1" "p2" "p3" --aspect 16:9 --model image4

# Text file input: comments and blank lines are ignored
gflow image t2i --prompts-file prompts.txt --fail-fast

# Pipeline input
Get-Content prompts.txt | gflow image t2i --stdin
```

A 4-image run with `--out ./logos/` produces:

```text
./logos/<media_name>_1.png
./logos/<media_name>_2.png
./logos/<media_name>_3.png
./logos/<media_name>_4.png
```

(`<media_name>` is the per-image UUID Flow assigns; the `_<n>` suffix is the 1-based index in the batch.)

## `gflow image i2i`

Generate 1–4 images by blending a text prompt with one or more reference images. Same flag set as `t2i`, plus a required `--ref` (repeatable).

```text
gflow image i2i PROMPT --ref PATH_OR_UUID [--ref ...] [OPTIONS]

Arguments:
  PROMPT                    Text prompt.                           [required]

Options:
  --ref PATH_OR_UUID        Reference image. Repeat for multiple. [required]
  --model [nano2|nano-pro|image4]
                            Image model alias.                [default: nano2]
  --aspect [9:16|16:9|1:1|4:3|3:4]
                            Aspect ratio.                     [default: 9:16]
  -n, --count INTEGER       How many images to generate (1-4).  [default: 1]
  --out PATH                Output directory (same semantics as t2i).
  -o, --output PATH         Explicit destination file path (same semantics as t2i).
  --project ID              Generate in this EXISTING Flow project (skip scratch).
  --reference-entity ID     Flow CHARACTER entity id to reference (repeatable;
                            must live in --project). Counts toward the ref cap.
  --reference-entity-name N Display name paired with --reference-entity.
  --profile NAME            Profile name (overrides default).
```

**Path-or-UUID semantics.** Each `--ref` value is classified at the CLI boundary:

- **Looks like a Flow asset UUID** (case-insensitive 8-4-4-4-12 hex, e.g. `ddb6ef97-262d-49f4-8269-4a28c0fae6a2`) → resolved through the local catalog (v0.58.0, #529): the asset's recorded Flow display name is searched in the project's reference picker and the **exact UUID tile** is selected — no duplicate upload, no grid scrolling, no UUID/prompt-text searches. A stale cached name self-heals ([#546](https://github.com/ffroliva/gflow-cli/issues/546)): on a picker miss in a known project, one free ~0.5 s listing fetch resolves the *current* name by UUID, the search is retried once, and the catalog is updated (`sync.source = "refresh"`) — a rename in the Flow UI costs one extra request, once. When the tile still can't be reached (different project, no recorded name), the catalog's recorded local file is uploaded instead — only after its byte count and SHA-256 still match the recording; otherwise the run aborts with a typed error rather than attaching the wrong bytes.
- **Anything else** → treated as a local path. The CLI canonicalises it (resolving symlinks once at validation time, closing the symlink-laundering vector where `./hero.png -> ~/.ssh/id_rsa` could exfiltrate secrets), then attaches it — **deduplicated by filename since v0.38.0 (#314):** if the target project's library already holds an asset with the exact same filename, that existing tile is selected in the picker instead of re-uploading, so repeating a ref across runs no longer piles up duplicate library entries. On a picker miss the file is uploaded as before. Caveat: the match is by exact filename only — a *different* image that happens to share the name of one already in the project will be reused, not uploaded; rename the file if you need a fresh upload. (Video `r2v` refs keep upload-only behavior.)

Mix and match in a single call. UUIDs and paths can co-exist on the same command line; order is preserved so `imageInputs[]` matches the order you typed.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Single ref by path (auto-uploaded)
gflow image i2i "make it cinematic, golden hour" --ref hero.png

# Two refs, both by path
gflow image i2i "blend these two compositions" --ref a.png --ref b.png

# Already-uploaded asset by UUID
gflow image i2i "stylize this asset" --ref ddb6ef97-262d-49f4-8269-4a28c0fae6a2

# Mix: one path, one UUID
gflow image i2i "mix references" --ref hero.png --ref ddb6ef97-262d-49f4-8269-4a28c0fae6a2

# 4-image fan-out from one ref, written flat
gflow image i2i "4 variants of this scene" --ref hero.png -n 4 --out ./variants
```

A 2-image run produces files numbered `_1.png`, `_2.png`:

```text
./variants/<media_name_a>_1.png
./variants/<media_name_b>_2.png
```

## `gflow image avatar`

Generate 1–4 images from a text prompt **plus the Avatar (likeness) already
saved on your Google account**. You do not supply a UUID: gflow selects the
Avatar through Flow's own Add Media dialog, and Flow's page JavaScript is what
puts `referenceLikenesses` on the request.

> **Availability:** Flow gates Avatar on identity verification **and** region.
> This is not a universal feature — see
> [§ Avatar availability](#avatar-availability-region-and-account-eligibility)
> before you rely on it.

```text
gflow image avatar PROMPT [--model] [--aspect] [-n/--count] [--out] [-o/--output]
                          [--profile] [--transport] [--project] [--project-name]
                          [--tool] [--ui-mode] [--json]
```

```bash
gflow image avatar "cinematic portrait in Bangkok"
gflow image avatar "on a neon rooftop" -n 4 --aspect 1:1
```

The flag set is `t2i`'s, minus the reference options. `--ref`,
`--reference-entity` and `-i/--instruction` are deliberately **absent**: the
request model refuses to mix the likeness with another reference kind (there is
no captured payload proving Flow accepts the combination on the image route),
and instructions require the agentic UI while the Avatar attach requires the
classic composer. For a local reference image use
[`gflow image i2i`](#gflow-image-i2i); for a reusable saved subject use
[`gflow character`](#gflow-character).

Operations are recorded in the local catalog under the `avatar` kind, so
`gflow data list images` and the operations history keep avatar runs
distinguishable from plain `t2i`.

## Character-consistent images (entity references)

`--reference-entity` makes `image t2i`/`i2i` reference a locked Flow **CHARACTER
entity** (minted via `gflow character create`) so the generated subject stays
on-model across shots — no per-shot prompt wrangling or fragile image refs.

How it works: entities are **project-scoped**, so you must generate **in the
project that owns them** via `--project <id>` (this also means no throwaway
scratch project is created). The CLI attaches each entity through the Flow editor's
resource picker; the submit then carries `referenceEntities`, exactly like the
video R2V path. Entities count toward the same per-model reference cap as `--ref`
images. `--reference-entity` / `--project` / `--output` are **single-prompt only**.

For a *pure* character reference (no starting image) use `t2i` — `i2i` still
requires at least one `--ref`.

```bash
# One locked character, consistent across runs (t2i = no image ref needed)
gflow image t2i "Aria explores a neon market, full body" \
  --project 7fa97443-… --reference-entity 8a77f8cb-… --reference-entity-name Aria \
  --model nano2 --aspect 9:16 -n 3

# Several characters in one scene (each --reference-entity repeatable)
gflow image t2i "Aria and Drako meet at the gate" --project 7fa97443-… \
  --reference-entity 8a77f8cb-… --reference-entity 4ed5cb7f-…

# i2i: a starting image PLUS an entity for the character
gflow image i2i "place this hero in a snowy pass" --ref hero.png \
  --project 7fa97443-… --reference-entity 8a77f8cb-…
```

## Referencing saved assets by name (`@Name` mentions)

Instead of ids or paths, you can reference a saved **Character** — or, on image
paths, a saved media asset — **inline in the prompt** by name, prefixed with `@`.
The mention is resolved against the project's assets, staged through the same
reference machinery as `--reference-entity` / `--ref`, then stripped from the text
the model sees. Shipped in v0.40.0 (#344).

```bash
# One saved Character by name (t2i needs no image ref)
gflow image t2i "@CaptainZoro on a rain-soaked neon rooftop, cinematic" --project <id>

# Two saved Characters in one video prompt (each staged as a reference, cap-checked)
gflow video r2v "@Zoro hands @Mika the sword" --project <id>
```

**Where `@Name` works** — character mentions on image **and** video; media/asset
mentions on image **only**:

| Path | Character `@Name` | Media/asset `@Name` |
|---|---|---|
| `image t2i` | ✅ | ✅ (in-project asset → `referenceImages`) |
| `image i2i` | ✅ | ✅ |
| `video t2v` / `i2v` / `r2v` | ✅ | ❌ — media-on-video is Phase 3; fails fast with **exit 11** |

Rules:
- **`--project <id>` is required** — mentions resolve against that project's assets.
- A name resolves against **Characters** (`gflow character create`) *and* saved
  media assets; on a name clash the **Character wins**. Matching is
  **case-insensitive**.
- A Character must have **at least one reference image** before it can be tagged,
  or the mention fails early.
- Write a **literal `@`** by doubling it: `@@` → `@` (e.g. `"ping me @@ 5pm"` →
  `ping me @ 5pm`). An `@` glued to a preceding word (`user@host`) is never a
  mention, so emails and handles are safe.
- Unknown or ambiguous names fail fast with **exit 11** (`ConfigurationError`),
  listing the available or colliding assets. If the asset catalog itself cannot be
  loaded you get **exit 29** (`MentionIndexUnavailableError`) — so scripts can tell
  "catalog unreachable" apart from "no such name".

`@Name` and `--reference-entity <id>` resolve to the **same** wire
(`referenceEntities`) and dedupe against each other: reach for `@Name` for the
inline, by-name path — and `--reference-entity` when you'd rather pin
an explicit entity id in a script. Both are available on `t2i`/`i2i` and on
`video t2v`/`r2v`; `video i2v` takes neither, because its DTO rejects reference
entities (it carries start/end frames instead). `--ref` is different: it
attaches an arbitrary **image** (`referenceImages`), not a saved identity, and can
be combined with a `@Name` for "this identity, in this look".

See [REFERENCE_STRATEGIES.md](REFERENCE_STRATEGIES.md) for the full decision guide.

## `gflow image batch`

Generate multiple images from a single manifest file. The format is dispatched by file extension (`.json` or `.tsv`).

### TSV manifest

Tab-separated columns. Only `prompt` is required; remaining columns fall back to the CLI defaults.

```
prompt<TAB>count<TAB>aspect_ratio<TAB>model
```

Lines starting with `#` and blank lines are skipped. Example: [`test_assets/sample_batch.tsv`](../test_assets/sample_batch.tsv).

```tsv
a small calico kitten sitting on a windowsill
a watercolor sunset over rolling hills	2	16:9
an isometric pixel-art bakery	1	1:1	nano2
```

### JSON manifest

```json
[
  {"text": "a small calico kitten sitting on a windowsill"},
  {"text": "a watercolor sunset over rolling hills", "count": 2, "aspect_ratio": "16:9"},
  {"text": "an isometric pixel-art bakery", "count": 1, "aspect_ratio": "1:1", "model": "nano2"}
]
```

Example: [`test_assets/sample_batch.json`](../test_assets/sample_batch.json).

### Session behaviour

All prompts in a batch share one Flow project. The editor is opened once and stays mounted; the transport is **strictly serial** — each prompt is configured, submitted, and its generation awaited before the next prompt is submitted, so only one generation is in flight at a time. The small random pause between submissions (default 0.5–1.5 seconds; tune with `--jitter` or `GFLOW_CLI_JITTER_RANGE`) is a **submission-cadence anti-bot-detection measure** on top of that serial rhythm. The command returns once every row has resolved (success or failure). See [DEBUGGING § WAF cadence](DEBUGGING.md#waf-cadence) for when to widen the range.

### Flags

- `--continue-on-error` / `--fail-fast` — keep going past row failures or stop at the first one (default: `--continue-on-error`, matching the CLI flag default). On fail-fast, already-completed images are downloaded before the error is surfaced.
- `--jitter SPEC` — anti-bot pause between submissions: `MIN-MAX` seconds (e.g. `10-30`), a single number for `0`–`N`, or `0` to disable. Default `0.5-1.5`; widen if runs hit WAF 403s. `GFLOW_CLI_JITTER_RANGE` overrides the default, the flag beats both.

### Limits

- `MAX_BATCH_PROMPTS = 5` (defined in `src/gflow_cli/image_batch.py`). To raise, edit the constant.

### Exit codes

- `0` — all rows succeeded.
- `1` — invalid manifest (file not found, parse error, unknown aspect/model).
- non-zero (other) — transport-level failure.

### Observability

`gflow image batch` emits four structlog events per run, useful for debugging throttling regressions:

- `image_batch.submission_attempt {row_idx, prompt_hash, aspect, model, jitter_enabled, t_since_prev_submit_ms, project_id}`
- `image_batch.submission_result {row_idx, outcome, latency_ms, ...}`
- `image_batch.row_completed {row_idx, file_path, sha256_prefix}` (per image)
- `image_batch.inter_submission_latency_ms {row_idx, latency_ms}` (fires from row 1 onward)

## `gflow video t2v`

Generate a video from a text prompt only.

```text
gflow video t2v PROMPT [--model] [--duration] [--count] [--aspect] [--ui-mode] [--profile] [-t/--tool] [--project] [--out-dir] [-o/--output]

Options:
  -o, --output PATH     Explicit destination file path for the generated asset
                        (e.g., `./out/clip.mp4`). Overrides automatic filename.
  --project ID          Generate in this EXISTING Flow project instead of a
                        scratch project (see "Sharing one project across calls").
  --ui-mode [auto|classic|agentic]
                        Which Flow UI arm to require (#299). Video only has a
                        classic driver: classic/auto verify the classic editor
                        pre-submit and abort with exit 28 ($0 spent) if it is
                        unreachable; agentic is rejected (exit 2) — not yet
                        supported for video. Also on `video i2v`.
```

```bash
gflow video t2v "Slow cinematic push-in toward a candle flame"
gflow video t2v "Aerial shot of a coastline at sunset" --aspect 16:9 --out-dir ./out
gflow video t2v "A neon city timelapse" --model omni-flash --duration 10 --count 2
# Apply the creative-director tool (cinematic style) before generating
gflow video t2v "a dog surfing" --tool creative-director:style=cinematic
```

`-t` / `--tool` applies a prompt tool before generating — see
[prompt tools](#gflow-image-t2i) under `image t2i` for the full contract
(requires `GFLOW_CLI_LLM_API_KEY` and/or `GFLOW_CLI_LLM_BASE_URL`; degrades gracefully to the original prompt).

## `gflow video i2v`

Generate a video from an INITIAL frame (+ optional END frame) and a motion prompt.
Each frame is a local PNG/JPEG **or the media UUID of an existing in-project asset**
(#287 — the asset is selected in place, no duplicate upload; pair with `--project`
so the UUID's project is the one being generated in). A local file is bound into
the editor's frame slot via the media dialog, then Flow fires
`batchAsyncGenerateVideoStartImage` (initial only) or `…StartAndEndImage`
(initial+end interpolation).

```text
gflow video i2v --initial-frame INITIAL [--end-frame LAST] PROMPT [--model] [--duration] [--count] [--aspect] [--ui-mode] [...]

# Back-compat positional form (still supported):
gflow video i2v IMAGE PROMPT [--end-frame LAST] [...]

Arguments:
  PROMPT  Motion prompt.  [required]

Options:
  --initial-frame PATH|UUID  Initial frame to animate: local image path or in-project
                             asset media UUID. Canonical form; replaces the positional IMAGE.
  --end-frame PATH|UUID      Optional end frame — Flow interpolates initial frame -> end frame.
  --project ID               Generate in this EXISTING Flow project instead of a
                             scratch project (see "Sharing one project across calls").
  -o, --output PATH          Explicit destination file path for the mp4 (parents
                             auto-created; overrides --out-dir).
```

```bash
gflow video i2v --initial-frame ./hero.png "Slow camera arc, soft golden light"
gflow video i2v --initial-frame ./first.png --end-frame ./last.png "morph between scenes" --model veo-quality
# Reference an existing in-project asset by media UUID (picker-selected via its
# catalog display name + exact-UUID tile since v0.58.0/#529; no re-upload):
gflow video i2v --initial-frame d6f1927a-3eae-4626-bc90-9a6ea7637bab "pan left" --project f6caf027-...
# Back-compat positional form:
gflow video i2v ./hero.png "Slow camera arc, soft golden light"
```

Exit codes specific to this surface: **27** — Flow's upload endpoint rejected a
local frame file (`MediaUploadRejectedError`; try re-encoding, e.g.
`ffmpeg -i in.jpg -q:v 2 -map_metadata -1 out.jpg`, or reference the asset by
UUID instead); **9** — a frame UUID could not be located in the project's media
picker **and** had no integrity-verified local fallback to upload
(`TransportTimeoutError`; wrong `--project`, foreign UUID, or the recorded
local file is missing/changed — since v0.58.0 a reachable verified local file
rescues a picker miss instead of failing).

## `gflow video r2v`

Reference-to-video (Flow "ingredients"): condition a generation on reference
images. Per-model cap: `omni-flash` ≤7, the `veo-*` models ≤3. Fires
`batchAsyncGenerateVideoReferenceImages`.

```text
gflow video r2v PROMPT --ref IMG [--ref IMG ...] [--model] [--duration] [--count] [--aspect] [...]

Options:
  --ref PATH    Reference image; repeat for up to 7 (omni-flash) / 3 (veo). [required]
  --project ID  Generate in this EXISTING Flow project instead of a scratch
                project (see "Sharing one project across calls").
```

```bash
gflow video r2v "a knight in this armor walks forward" --ref armor.png
gflow video r2v "blend these worlds" --ref a.png --ref b.png --ref c.png --model omni-flash
```

### Adding your Avatar to an r2v generation

`--avatar` attaches your Flow Avatar (likeness) **alongside** the reference
images, in one generation — Flow carries `referenceLikenesses` and
`referenceImages` together:

```bash
gflow video r2v "walking with the referenced subjects" --ref subject.png --avatar
```

The per-model reference cap is unchanged: the Avatar is not an ingredient and
does not consume a reference slot, but it does not raise the cap either.

## `gflow video avatar`

Generate a video from a text prompt **plus the Avatar (likeness) saved on your
Google account**, with no image inputs at all. As with `image avatar`, no UUID
is needed — gflow drives Flow's Add Media dialog and Flow's own JavaScript
builds the request.

```text
gflow video avatar PROMPT [--aspect] [--model] [--duration] [--count]
                          [--profile] [--project] [--project-name] [--tool]
                          [--out-dir] [-o/--output] [--ui-mode] [--json]
```

```bash
gflow video avatar "walking through Bangkok at night"
gflow video avatar "cinematic walk" --model omni-flash --duration 8
```

Notes:

- Attaching the likeness requires Flow's References/Ingredients sub-mode (the
  Add Media button is not rendered on the bare Video tab), so **`--model
  veo-quality` is rejected** — it offers no ingredients workflow. Use
  `omni-flash`, `veo-lite`, `veo-fast` or `veo-lite-lp`, or omit `--model` to
  accept Flow's current default.
- `--duration` still requires `--model omni-flash` (the Veo 3.1 models render no
  duration control — see [`gflow video t2v`](#gflow-video-t2v)).
- Frames and reference images are rejected: this mode is prompt + likeness only.
  For Avatar together with reference images use `gflow video r2v --avatar`.
- Operations are recorded under the `avatar` kind.

## Avatar availability (region and account eligibility)

Flow's Avatar/likeness is **verified-identity and region gated by Google**. It
requires the one-time avatar scan on your Google Account, and it is not offered
in every region: `GET /v1/flow/likeness:checkEligibility` returns
`{"ineligibilityReasons": ["REGION"]}` for the accounts this project was
developed against. gflow makes no claim that your account can use it.

What gflow does about it:

1. **Pre-flight.** Before generating, gflow calls the free eligibility endpoint.
   A definitive "not eligible" aborts with **exit 35**
   (`AvatarUnavailableError`) — no reCAPTCHA token minted, no credits spent.
2. **Media-dialog gate.** If the pre-flight answer is inconclusive (a network
   blip, an unrecognised response shape), gflow opens Flow's Add Media dialog
   and looks for the Avatar tab. Other tabs present but no Avatar tab is also
   exit 35, still **before** the prompt is submitted.
3. **No silent degradation.** gflow never falls back to a plain t2i/t2v
   generation without the likeness. If the Avatar cannot be attached, nothing is
   submitted.

If you hit exit 35, confirm the Avatar tab works in Flow's own web UI at
<https://labs.google/fx/tools/flow> first. If it does not, use
[`gflow character`](#gflow-character) for a reusable subject or `--ref` for a
one-off reference image instead; re-running will not change a region verdict.

### Sharing one project across calls

By default each `video t2v` / `i2v` / `r2v` call creates its own scratch Flow
project. Pass `--project <id>` (same contract as `image t2i`/`i2i` — see
[`gflow image t2i`](#gflow-image-t2i)) to generate into an existing project
instead, e.g. to avoid one-throwaway-project-per-clip when scripting a
multi-clip storyboard:

```bash
gflow video t2v "establishing shot" --project PROJ123
gflow video t2v "close-up reaction" --project PROJ123
```

## Batch video generation (shell loop)

`gflow video` has no `batch` subcommand — a manifest-driven video runner
was scaffolded early on but never worked and was removed. `gflow image
batch` (manifest-driven image generation) is unaffected and still ships. For
video, drive sequential generations through a plain shell loop instead.
Without `--project`, each `gflow video t2v` / `i2v` / `r2v` call opens its
**own Flow project**, so the resulting videos will NOT share a `project_id`
(unlike `gflow image batch`, which mounts one project across all prompts) —
but they DO get generated and downloaded. Pass the same `--project <id>` to
every call in the loop (see "Sharing one project across calls" above) if you
want them to land in one project instead:

```bash
# bash / WSL / macOS — one prompt per line
while IFS= read -r prompt; do
  gflow video t2v "$prompt" --aspect 9:16
done < prompts.txt
```

```powershell
# PowerShell — one prompt per line
Get-Content prompts.txt | ForEach-Object {
  gflow video t2v $_ --aspect 9:16
}
```

The trade-off vs. a manifest runner: separate `project_id`s mean each
generation re-mints a reCAPTCHA (a few extra seconds per shot) and the
videos won't appear together in your Flow gallery. The same pattern works
for `gflow video i2v <image> "<prompt>"` and
`gflow video r2v "<prompt>" --ref <img>`.

## `gflow video chain`

Render a JSONL manifest of *links* into one continuous last-frame I2V chain.
Link 0 is a text-to-video (T2V) generation; every later link is an
image-to-video (I2V) generation **seeded by the extracted last frame of the
previous clip**, giving visual continuity with no server-side stitching.

> ⚠️ **Each link is a pending video generation operation.** A chain submits N
> sequential Veo generations that may consume credits; current cost varies by
> model, duration, account tier, and Flow policy — check Google Flow before
> submitting. An accepted operation may consume credits even if later polling
> or download fails. Run `--dry-run` first to print the plan without
> submitting anything. The confirmation prompt is shown unless you pass
> `-y` / `--yes`.

> **Requires the `chain` extra.** The last-frame extractor decodes the previous
> clip with [PyAV](https://pyav.org/) (no system ffmpeg needed). Install it
> with:
>
> ```bash
> pip install 'gflow-cli[chain]'
> # or:  uv tool install 'gflow-cli[chain]'
> ```

```text
gflow video chain MANIFEST [OPTIONS]

Arguments:
  MANIFEST                  JSONL manifest, one link per line. [required]

Options:
  --model [veo-lite|veo-fast|veo-quality|veo-lite-lp]
                            Veo 3.1 model for every link.    [default: veo-lite]
  --max-links INTEGER       Cap link count; error (exit 11) if the manifest
                            has more links than this.
  -y, --yes                 Skip the per-credit cost confirmation prompt.
  --dry-run                 Resolve the manifest, print the plan + credit cost,
                            and spend nothing.
  --resume-from CHAIN_ID    Resume a prior chain by its id; already-paid links
                            are skipped (not re-billed).
  --jitter FLOAT            Random 0..JITTER second pause between links
                            (anti-bot cadence).               [default: 0.0]
  --seed-offset INTEGER     Extract the seed frame this many ms before EOF
                            (fade-to-black guard).            [default: 0]
  --aspect [9:16|16:9]      Uniform aspect for every link.    [default: 9:16]
  --profile NAME            Profile name (overrides default).
  --out-dir DIR             Directory for the link mp4s + seed frames.
  --json                    Emit a machine-readable JSON result.
```

> **`omni-flash` is rejected for chains.** Its single-clip start-frame i2v is
> wire-verified (2026-08-03, issue #125), but a chain renders N seeded links

### JSONL manifest format

One JSON object per line. Only `prompt` is required; `model` / `duration` /
`aspect` are optional per-link overrides (omit to inherit the chain default).
Blank lines and `#`-prefixed comment lines are skipped.

```jsonl
{"prompt": "a lone wolf on a snowy ridge at dawn, cinematic", "model": "veo-lite", "duration": 4, "aspect": "16:9"}
{"prompt": "it lifts its head and turns to face the camera"}
{"prompt": "it bounds down the slope toward the valley"}
```

The chain enforces a **uniform aspect** across links for continuity, so the
chain-level `--aspect` is applied to every link (a per-link `aspect` override in
the manifest is currently informational).

### Output — N clips, not one file

Each link is saved as its own mp4 (plus a `linkN_lastframe.jpg` seed frame
between links) under `--out-dir` (or the default output dir). **Stitching the
clips into a single video is a separate step — use `gflow scene` to
concatenate them server-side.** Chain does not auto-concat: see the
*deferred auto-concat* entry in
[KNOWN_ISSUES](../KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for why.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Preview the pending video operation plan — submits nothing
gflow video chain story.jsonl --dry-run

# Generate the chain (one pending video operation per link), no confirmation prompt
gflow video chain story.jsonl --model veo-fast --aspect 16:9 --yes

# Resume a chain that died partway — already-completed links are skipped
gflow video chain story.jsonl --resume-from 1f2e3d4c-...

# Seed 150 ms before EOF to dodge a fade-to-black final frame
gflow video chain story.jsonl --seed-offset 150 --yes
```

## `gflow instructions`

Manage a project's **Agent Instruction cards** — the brief Flow's agent consults when it
generates. Enabled cards steer output (style, references) on **agentic-cohort** sessions.
Setting up cards is **credits-free**. Full guide: [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md).

**Shipped (v0.28.0):** the ephemeral `-i / --instruction "text"` flag on `gflow image t2i` /
`i2i` adds a one-off enabled text card for that generation.

```bash
gflow image t2i "a cat on a chair" -i "flat 2D children's crayon drawing"
```

**Persistent cards:** the `gflow instructions add/list/enable/disable/rm/apply/toggle-mode`
CRUD group manages a project's brief, with a single generic `--ref` per card that accepts an
image path, a generated-image UUID, or a character id/name (image → `imageReferenceMediaIds`,
character → `characterReferenceEntityNames`). Cards are selected by **title** (case-insensitive)
by default, or by the stable server `--id` for the ambiguous-title / scripting case (mirrors
`gflow character`'s `--name` / `--entity-id`). Every subcommand requires `--project`. See
[INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md) for the full reference.

```text
gflow instructions add   TITLE --text TEXT [--ref REF]... --project ID [--disabled]
gflow instructions list  --project ID [--json]
gflow instructions enable  (TITLE | --id ID) --project ID
gflow instructions disable (TITLE | --id ID) --project ID
gflow instructions rm      (TITLE | --id ID) --project ID
gflow instructions apply   FILE  --project ID     # declarative full-sync (TOML/JSON)
gflow instructions toggle-mode (--on | --off) --project ID
```

## `gflow tools`

Discover and run **prompt tools** — named, single-purpose transforms applied to a prompt
before generation. The first built-in is `creative-director` (the Gemini "Creative Director").
Apply a tool inline on any generation command with `-t/--tool` (see [prompt tools](#gflow-image-t2i)),
or use this group standalone. Full reference: [TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md) · [PROMPT_EXPANSION.md](PROMPT_EXPANSION.md).

```text
gflow tools list [--json]
gflow tools show NAME [--json]
gflow tools run NAME "INPUT" [--style MODE] [--json]
```

- **`list`** — registered tools (name, title, category, description). Includes your own
  "My Tools" TOMLs from `<GFLOW_CLI_HOME>/tools/*.toml`.
- **`show NAME`** — full spec incl. required env and available `--style` modes.
- **`run NAME "INPUT"`** — run the tool standalone (no generation, no credits); pipeable.
  Emits `{name, original, expanded, was_expanded}` with `--json`.

```bash
gflow tools list

## `gflow scene`

Compose ordered, trimmable video clips into a Flow **Scene** (the "Add Clip"
timeline). This is a **credit-free, reCAPTCHA-free** REST path: it arranges
*existing* clips (e.g. the per-link mp4s from `gflow video chain`) — it does not
generate anything. Each clip is referenced by its **workflow id**, optionally
trimmed with a `start-end` window in seconds.

### `gflow scene create`

```text
gflow scene create CLIP_REFS... [OPTIONS]

Arguments:
  CLIP_REFS...              One or more clips, in order. Each is
                            `workflowId[:start-end]` (trim in seconds, start<end).
                            [required]

Options:
  --project PROJECT_ID      Flow project id.                          [required]
  -o, --output PATH         Render the composed scene into ONE extended .mp4 at
                            PATH (server-side, credit-free, no local ffmpeg).
                            Without it, only the Flow scene is composed (no file).
  --force                   Overwrite --output if it already exists.
  --profile NAME            Profile name (overrides default).
```

With `--output`, gflow calls Flow's server-side `runVideoFxConcatenation` to
stitch the clips into a single extended video. The render is **credit-free** and
needs **no local ffmpeg** — Flow returns the encoded video inline (base64) and
gflow writes it to PATH (a `.mp4` suffix is enforced; takes up to ~3 min). The
compose is **persisted to the local catalog before** the render, so a render
failure is recoverable without re-composing. A non-`.mp4` `--output` is
rewritten to `.mp4`; an existing file errors unless `--force` is passed.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Compose three chain clips into a scene (no local file)
gflow scene create wf-aaa wf-bbb wf-ccc --project proj-123

# Same, but also render one extended .mp4 (credit-free, server-side)
gflow scene create wf-aaa wf-bbb wf-ccc --project proj-123 --output story.mp4

# Trim the middle clip to its 2.0–6.5s window before concatenating
gflow scene create wf-aaa wf-bbb:2.0-6.5 wf-ccc --project proj-123 -o story.mp4 --force
```

### `gflow scene show`

```text
gflow scene show --scene SCENE_ID --project PROJECT_ID [--profile NAME]

Options:
  --scene SCENE_ID          Scene id to read back.                     [required]
  --project PROJECT_ID      Flow project id.                           [required]
  --profile NAME            Profile name (overrides default).
```

Reads a scene back and prints each clip's position, workflow id, trim window,
source duration, and the composed total duration.

## `gflow character`

Create and manage reusable **Flow Character entities** — project-scoped,
broadly-available identities you can reuse across generations (#145). Full
design + wire protocol: [CHARACTER](CHARACTER.md). Every subcommand takes
`--project <id>` (required); use `--id`/`--name` flags, never a positional.

### `gflow character create`

> ⚠️ **Costs credits.** `create` runs **two paid image generations**: a face
> reference (slot 0), then a front/side/back triptych body (slot 1) seeded by
> that face. It runs as a **persist-before-spend, crash-recoverable saga** — the
> entity id and workflow rows are recorded before the credited generation, so a
> crashed run is recoverable. Generation requires a Chrome-strategy profile.

```text
gflow character create [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --project PROJECT_ID      Flow project id.                           [required]
  --name NAME               Display name for the new character.        [required]
  --face-prompt TEXT        Prompt for the face reference image.       [required]
  --body-prompt TEXT        Body/outfit DESCRIPTION (not a full prompt). gflow
                            wraps it in a self-contained front/side/back triptych
                            instruction seeded by the generated face, so one
                            generation yields all three angles. Omit to skip the
                            body step.
  --voice NAME              Preset voice (e.g. Charon); case-insensitive,
                            validated against `gflow character voices`.
  --personality TEXT        Personality notes for the character.
  --model [nano2|nanopro]   nano2 = Nano Banana 2 (default);
                            nanopro = Nano Banana Pro.            [default: nano2]
  --profile NAME            Profile name (overrides default).
  --locale TEXT             BCP-47 locale.                       [default: en-US]
  --json                    Emit a machine-readable JSON result.
```

There is **no aspect-ratio control** for characters. Generated images are
**downloaded** to local (or cloud) storage; the signed `fifeUrl` is used only at
download time and never persisted. The result reports the entity id, the bound
workflow ids, and each saved slot's local path (face, body).

### `gflow character list`

```text
gflow character list --project PROJECT_ID [--json] [--profile NAME]
```

Lists every Character entity in a project (name, entity id, voice, reference
count).

### `gflow character show`

```text
gflow character show --project PROJECT_ID (--id ENTITY_ID | --name NAME) [--json] [--profile NAME]
```

Shows one character's detail (entity id, project, voice, personality, reference
workflow ids). Provide **exactly one** of `--id` or `--name`. An ambiguous
`--name` (multiple characters share it) exits with code **11**.

### `gflow character rm`

```text
gflow character rm --project PROJECT_ID (--id ENTITY_ID | --name NAME) [--yes] [--json] [--profile NAME]
```

Deletes a Character by `--id` or `--name`. Provide **exactly one** of `--id` or
`--name`. Prompts for confirmation unless `--yes` (or `--json`) is supplied; an
ambiguous `--name` (multiple characters share it) exits with code **11**.
**FREE** — no reCAPTCHA, no credit (`POST flow:batchDeleteAssets`).

### `gflow character voices`

```text
gflow character voices [--json]
```

Lists the **29 preset Gemini voices** available for character TTS — each with a
name, description, and sample URL. These names are what `--voice` validates
against (case-insensitively) on `gflow character create`.

## `gflow data list`

Read-only browse over the local SQLite catalog. Shipped in v0.9.0.

```text
gflow data list projects   [--profile NAME] [--limit N] [--offset N] [--json]
gflow data list images     [--profile NAME] [--limit N] [--offset N] [--json] [--all-copies]
gflow data list videos     [--profile NAME] [--limit N] [--offset N] [--json] [--all-copies]
gflow data list profiles                    [--limit N] [--offset N] [--json]
gflow data list errors     [--profile NAME] [--limit N] [--offset N] [--json]

Options:
  --profile NAME        Filter to one profile (not available on `profiles`).
  --limit N             Max rows returned. Range 1..1000. Default 20.
  --offset N            Rows to skip (pagination). Default 0.
  --json                Force JSONL output (one record per line).
  --all-copies          Show every local file copy separately (images/videos only).
```

By default, `images` and `videos` aggregate rows by Flow media ID. If an asset
has multiple local copies (e.g. re-downloaded to different paths), they appear
as a single row with a `COPIES` count and the path of the latest copy. Use
`--all-copies` to see every path as a separate row.

Output:
- TTY stdout → Rich-formatted table.
- Pipe / non-TTY / `--json` → JSONL.

Default sort: newest first (by `created_at`). Exit codes: 0 success (including the empty-catalog case — a missing/freshly-created DB is auto-migrated and returns 0 with no rows) / 2 Click usage / **16** `DataStoreError` family (migration mismatch, permission denied, corrupt schema). See [#88](https://github.com/ffroliva/gflow-cli/issues/88).

**Examples:**

```bash
# Newest 20 projects across all profiles
gflow data list projects

# All images for one profile, aggregated by asset by default
gflow data list images --profile ffroliva --limit 50 --offset 0

# Show every local file copy separately
gflow data list images --all-copies

# Videos as JSONL for piping into jq
gflow data list videos --json | jq '.media_id'

# Profiles with at least one recorded generation
gflow data list profiles

# Failed generations, newest first (v0.39.0+, #341): started_at, command, mode,
# model, profile, error_type (waf-rejection, content-policy, ...), redacted detail
gflow data list errors --profile my-profile --json | jq '{started_at, error_type}'
```

`errors` lists terminal `status="failed"` operation rows — every paid
generation that raised (WAF 403, content policy, cohort pin, timeout, auth)
is recorded before the CLI exits, so block onset/recovery windows are
measurable. `error_detail` is redacted before persistence (no tokens, cookies,
or signed URLs). See
[`DATA_LAYER.md § Failure recording`](DATA_LAYER.md#failure-recording-341-v0390).

> **`data list profiles` vs `gflow auth list`** — `data list profiles` shows profiles that have **recorded generations** in the catalog; `gflow auth list` shows profiles that have ever **logged in** via `gflow auth login`. A profile that logged in but never generated anything will appear in `auth list` but not in `data list profiles`.

For full schema details and JOIN semantics, see [`docs/DATA_LAYER.md § Querying the data layer`](DATA_LAYER.md#querying-the-data-layer).

## `gflow data prune`

Remove `local_files` database entries whose local paths no longer exist on
disk. Shipped in v0.9.1.

```bash
gflow data prune [--dry-run] [--profile NAME]
```

Useful after test runs that wrote to temporary directories, or after manually
deleting media files. Only **local files** (where `storage_provider` is NULL)
are scanned; cloud-stored assets are ignored to prevent accidental pruning of
remote objects.

Options:
  --dry-run             Preview dead rows without deleting.
  --profile NAME        Limit scan to a specific profile.

## `gflow data media`

Look up a recorded operation by its Flow media ID. Prints a summary of the stored provenance record: profile, media ID, Flow project ID, kind (image/video), and the local paths or cloud URIs that were written for that operation.

Without `--profile` the lookup spans **every profile** in the catalog — matching the cross-profile default of `gflow data list`. Pass `--profile NAME` to scope to a specific profile (this is the way to disambiguate the rare case where two profiles share the same Flow `media_id`; the command refuses to guess and lists the candidates annotated with `kind`). See [#87](https://github.com/ffroliva/gflow-cli/issues/87).

```text
gflow data media MEDIA_ID [--profile NAME]

Arguments:
  MEDIA_ID              Flow media UUID (e.g. ddb6ef97-262d-49f4-8269-4a28c0fae6a2). [required]

Options:
  --profile NAME        Scope the lookup to a specific profile.
                        Default: search all profiles.
```

**Example output:**

```text
Profile:    default
Media ID:   ddb6ef97-262d-49f4-8269-4a28c0fae6a2
Project ID: f1a2b3c4-0000-0000-0000-000000000001
Kind:       image
Paths:
  /home/user/Downloads/gflow-cli/images/2026-05-24/ddb6ef97_1.png
  /home/user/Downloads/gflow-cli/images/2026-05-24/ddb6ef97_2.png
```

When [`GFLOW_CLI_STORAGE_URI`](EXTERNAL_STORAGE.md) was active for the run, the
same command prints `cloud_uri_1`, `cloud_uri_2`, and so on instead of
`local_path_N` rows.

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` media ID not found in the local database, `16` database error (see exit code table below).

## `gflow data sync`

Reconcile the local catalog's display names against Flow's own project-listing
endpoint (`flow.projectInitialData`) — the source of the captions the media
picker searches by. **Credit-free**: one listing GET per project (~0.5s,
session-cookie auth); no generation surface is touched. **Writes by
default** — pass `--dry-run` to preview.

```text
gflow data sync --names [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --names               Sync display names + presence (required; the only
                        sync mode, explicit by design).
  --project ID          Limit the sweep to specific Flow project id(s).
                        Repeatable.
  --limit N             Visit at most N nameless projects (newest first).
  --since DATETIME      Only consider rows created at/after this time
                        (e.g. 2026-08-01 or 2026-08-01T12:00:00).
  --all                 Explicit full sweep of all nameless projects
                        (this is also the default scope).
  --max-projects N      Hard cap on projects visited per run.  [default: 50]
  --dry-run             Fetch listings and preview what would be written
                        (no DB writes). Without it, sync WRITES by default.
  --json                Emit a JSON summary instead of text.
  --profile NAME        Profile whose catalog rows to sync.
```

**What it fixes.** Rows recorded before the caption existed (Flow computes
display names asynchronously server-side), or recorded by a pre-0.58.0
version, have no stored name — so `--ref <uuid>` runs fall back to a duplicate
re-upload instead of a picker selection. One sync pass restores the names and
the picker path works again.

**Scoping.** The default sweep visits every project that still has nameless,
non-ghost rows, newest first. `--project` restricts to explicit project ids,
`--limit` caps how many nameless projects are considered, `--since` drops rows
created before the cutoff, and `--max-projects` is the hard visit cap on top
of whichever scope applies.

**Multiple profiles.** Sync operates on **one profile per run** — the
resolved default, or the one named with `--profile`. With several profiles,
run it once per profile. `gflow doctor` shows the per-profile split in its
catalog counts (e.g. `12 asset(s) have no display name (my-profile: 9, work: 3)`)
so you can see which profiles still need a pass.

**Ghost marking.** When a listing is provably complete (no pagination
markers) **and** contains at least one media item (a mass-tombstone guard
against a Flow shape drift hiding the whole `media[]` array), cataloged rows
whose media no longer exists remotely are flagged
`sync.status = "missing_remote"` — a tombstone, **never a deletion**: the
row and its provenance stay queryable, and tombstoned rows are skipped by
later sweeps. On a partial listing absence proves nothing, so nothing is
ghost-marked.

**Un-ghosting.** A tombstoned row whose media reappears in a later listing
has its tombstone cleared automatically; if still nameless it rejoins the
next sweep.

**Privacy gate.** Display names are prompt-derived captions, so under
`GFLOW_CLI_HISTORY_PROMPTS=redacted` sync refuses up front (exit `11`) with a
remediation naming the env var — nothing is fetched or written.

**Exit codes.** `0` success (including a no-op run); `34` partial failure —
some projects failed, at least one succeeded (`SyncPartialError`, retryable:
completed writes stay committed and a re-run resumes where it left off); `11`
redacted-mode refusal; `2` usage error (e.g. missing `--names`).

```bash
# Preview the full sweep without writing
gflow data sync --names --dry-run

# Restore names for one project
gflow data sync --names --project 6e4460fb-e955-4a44-806c-9b34d4998c9f

# Bounded background-friendly sweep, machine-readable summary
gflow data sync --names --limit 10 --json
```

Sync is **idempotent**: a second run over an already-reconciled catalog visits
nothing, writes nothing, and leaves every row's metadata byte-identical — safe
to schedule or re-run after a partial failure.

## `gflow doctor`

Read-only pre-flight diagnostics over the local catalog, database, and
environment. Doctor **diagnoses, never heals**: nothing is migrated, repaired,
or written — not even pending schema migrations. All database access is
strictly read-only (SQLite may create transient `-wal`/`-shm` sidecar files
during the read-only open; the database itself is never modified), so it is
safe to run against a live catalog at any time.

```text
gflow doctor [--json]

Options:
  --json                Emit a machine-readable JSON report
                        (experimental; shape may change).
```

Ten checks run on every invocation:

| Check id | Detects | Suggested remediation |
|---|---|---|
| `catalog.display_name_missing` | Assets with no recorded display name (the picker search key) | `gflow data sync --names` |
| `catalog.local_file_missing` | Cataloged local files that no longer exist on disk | `gflow data prune --dry-run` |
| `catalog.sha256_null` | Local files with no recorded sha256 | `gflow data sync` |
| `db.migration_drift` | Schema does not match the packaged migrations, or was written by a newer gflow-cli | `gflow data sync` / `uv tool upgrade gflow-cli` |
| `db.wal_state` | Stale `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars next to a non-WAL database; `PRAGMA quick_check` anomalies | Close other gflow processes and re-run; restore from backup on quick_check failures |
| `operations.stuck_started` | Operations in `started` for over 24h with no completion | `gflow data errors prune` |
| `queue.stuck_processing` | Queue tasks claimed as `processing` for over 24h | `gflow data prune --dry-run` |
| `env.deprecated_vars` | Deprecated env vars still set (`GFLOW_CLI_PREFER_CLASSIC`, `GFLOW_CLI_FORCE_AGENT_UI`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`), or `GFLOW_CLI_DB_PATH` disagreeing with the resolved settings path | Unset the variable / switch to its successor |
| `env.browsers_missing` | Playwright Chromium is not installed | `playwright install chromium` |
| `auth.files_present` | No auth profiles, or profiles without saved cookies | `gflow auth login` |

**Severity model.** Every check reports `pass`, `info`, `warn`, or `fail`.
`info` is worth knowing but not a defect — it never flips the overall status
or the exit code; only `warn`/`fail` do. In the brew-doctor spirit the report
itself says it best: findings are diagnostic signals, not a to-do list — if
everything is working as expected, there is no need to chase them.

**Exit codes.** `0` when every check passes (info findings included), `33`
when any warn/fail finding is present — a successful diagnosis, not an error
class. Internal errors keep their standard typed codes (e.g. `16` when the
database cannot be opened at all — see the exit-code table below).

**`--json` (experimental).** Emits a machine-readable envelope whose contract
keys are `overall_status` (`ok`/`issues`) and `checks[]`, each entry carrying
at least `check` (the id from the table above) and `severity`. The shape may
grow; treat unknown keys as forward-compatible.

**Redacted history.** Doctor output is redaction-safe: rows are identified by
UUID only (never display-name values), and paths are sanitized. Under
`GFLOW_CLI_HISTORY_PROMPTS=redacted` the `catalog.display_name_missing` check
reports `info` instead of `warn` — name backfill is deliberately suppressed by
that privacy setting, so missing names are expected, not a defect.

## `gflow models`

Print the image and video model catalog — the source of truth for what
`--model` accepts on the generation commands. Defaults to a Rich table; pass
`--json` for a single machine-readable object.

```text
gflow models [OPTIONS]
```

Per model the catalog reports: `name`, the CLI aliases the matching generation
command's `--model` choice actually accepts, `ref_cap` (max reference images),
plus `default` (image models) and `max_duration` (video models). Because it is
built from the same `Model` / `VideoModel` enums + alias maps the generation
commands use, any alias it prints is guaranteed to be accepted back by
`--model` — a UI populating its model picker from `gflow models --json` can
round-trip every value.

```bash
# Human-readable table
gflow models

# Machine-readable catalog for a worker / model picker
gflow models --json
```

## JSON output (`--json`)

The generation commands (`image t2i` / `image i2i`, `video t2v` / `i2v` /
`r2v`), `auth list`, and `gflow models` accept `--json` for machine-to-machine
use. When set:

- The command emits **one** parseable JSON object (or array, for `auth list`)
  on **stdout** and nothing else — progress chatter is suppressed and structured
  logs go to **stderr**, so `json.loads(stdout)` always succeeds.
- `image t2i/i2i` emits the complete `GeneratedImage` result (`media_name`,
  `workflow_id`, `seed`, `prompt`, `model_name_type`, `aspect_ratio`,
  `dimensions`, `fife_url`, `is_signed_url`) plus the on-disk `local_path`;
  `ref_count` is included on `i2i`. Single-prompt only — `--json` rejects
  multi-prompt batches with a Click usage error.
- `video t2v/i2v/r2v` emits the `VideoResult` (`status`, `command`, `media_id`,
  `generation_status`, `succeeded`, `local_path`, `failure_reasons`,
  `error_message`) plus the request echo (`model`, `mode`, `aspect`,
  `duration`, `count`, `seed`).
- On failure, the command still emits a JSON payload — an RFC 9457
  problem-details object including a `retryable` flag (true for WAF /
  rate-limit / network / timeout) that a worker scheduler can key its
  retry-vs-absorb decision off — and exits with the same non-zero code as the
  Rich path.

The data-layer recorder fires regardless of `--json`, so audit history is
independent of the output channel.

## `gflow mcp`

Model Context Protocol server for IDE/agent integration. Full reference: [MCP.md](MCP.md).

- **`gflow mcp run [--profile NAME] [--no-spend]`** — start the MCP server over **stdio** (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code). Auto-selects your default profile; pin one with `--profile` or `GFLOW_CLI_PROFILE`. `--no-spend` (#496) never registers the two credit-spending tools (`gflow_generate_image`, `gflow_generate_video`), so a connected agent cannot even see them in `tools/list` — read-only tools stay available. `GFLOW_MCP_NO_SPEND=1` does the same and also covers `gflow serve` (which takes the same flag). See [CONFIGURATION § GFLOW_MCP_NO_SPEND](CONFIGURATION.md#gflow_mcp_no_spend).
- **`gflow mcp setup [--target claude-desktop|cursor|vscode]`** — write the gflow server entry into the target client's config. Non-destructive: existing content is merged, an existing `gflow`/`gflow-cli` entry is left untouched ("Already configured"), a pre-existing file is backed up once as `<name>.gflow-backup`, and a corrupt config fails loud (exit 11) without being modified. See [MCP.md § Setup Instructions](MCP.md#4-setup-instructions).

For MCP over HTTP, see `gflow serve` and [MCP.md](MCP.md).

## `gflow run`

Sequential JSON-described batch image generation. New in v0.5.0a1.

```text
gflow run --config FILE [--output-dir DIR] [--profile NAME] [--continue-on-error|--fail-fast]
```

The config is a JSON file with a top-level `prompts` array; each entry
produces 1–4 images through one `FlowApiClient` session (one Playwright
browser, one Flow project, sequential reCAPTCHA mints).

### Config schema

```json
{
  "profile": "<your-profile>",
  "transport": "ui_automation",
  "output_dir": "out/example-batch",
  "prompts": [
    {
      "text": "a quiet mountain lake at dawn, cinematic photography",
      "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
      "model": "nano2",
      "count": 1,
      "output_filename": "lake_scene"
    },
    {
      "text": "a sunlit forest path in autumn",
      "aspect_ratio": "16:9"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Key | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `prompts` | **yes** | — | 1–50 entries. |
| `prompts[].text` | **yes** | — | 1–2000 chars. |
| `prompts[].aspect_ratio` | no | `9:16` | `9:16` / `16:9` / `1:1` / `4:3` / `3:4`. |
| `prompts[].model` | no | `nano2` | `nano2` / `nano-pro` / `imagen4`. |
| `prompts[].count` | no | `1` | 1–4. |
| `prompts[].output_filename` | no | `prompt_<index>` | Filename stem; saved as `<stem>_<image-index>.png`. |
| `profile` | no | active profile | CLI `--profile` overrides. |
| `transport` | no | `ui_automation` | Experimental strategies need `GFLOW_CLI_EXPERIMENTAL_TRANSPORTS=1`. |
| `output_dir` | no | `out/<UTC-timestamp>/` | CLI `--output-dir` overrides. |

### Error semantics

`--continue-on-error` (default): one prompt failing logs the error and continues. Final exit code is the max per-prompt exit code (so a `WafRejectionError` anywhere in the batch makes the whole run exit 10).

`--fail-fast`: first failure stops the batch. Remaining prompts are reported as SKIPPED in the summary table.

### Example

```bash
GFLOW_EXAMPLE_PROFILE=<your-profile> python examples/batch_from_config.py
```

The bundled `examples/sample_config.json` produces three images at three aspect ratios in `gflow-output/example-batch/`. Copy and edit for your own scenes.

## `gflow movie`

Sequential TOML-described multi-scene AI movie generation. New in v0.14.0.

### `gflow movie template`

Writes a starter `movie.toml` template.

```text
gflow movie template [OUTPUT] [--force]
```

* `OUTPUT`: The destination path for the template file (defaults to `./movie.toml`).
* `--force`: Overwrite the destination file if it already exists.

### `gflow movie run`

Generates individual video clips sequentially from a single TOML manifest file, maintaining crash-recoverable state in a local state JSON file.

```text
gflow movie run MANIFEST [--out-dir DIR] [--profile NAME] [--continue-on-error|--fail-fast] [--dry-run] [--stitch]
```

Refer to the complete [Movie Manifests Guide](MOVIE.md) for detailed syntax, character entity creation, and style consistency features.

### Parameters

* `MANIFEST`: Path to your `movie.toml` manifest file (required positional argument).
* `--out-dir DIR`: Output directory for generated video clips and the handoff file. Defaults to `out/` or `GFLOW_CLI_OUTPUT_DIR`.
* `--profile NAME`: Specify Google Flow profile to use.
* `--continue-on-error`: Skip failed scenes and continue generating subsequent scenes (default).
* `--fail-fast`: Terminate immediately on the first failed scene generation.
* `--dry-run`: Parse the manifest, estimate credits, and print the generation plan without calling Google Flow.
* `--stitch`: Run a post-generation preview stitch using ffmpeg to concatenate clips into a single video file.

### Manifest structure (movie.toml)

```toml
title = "My Cinematic Film"
project = "Cinematics"

[style]
look = "3d animation"
mood = "mysterious"
negative = "text, watermark"
prefix = "Cinematic film still, high detail."
suffix = "Shot on IMAX 70mm, unreal engine 5 render."

[style.variants.warm]
suffix = "Golden hour light, warm color grading."

[[characters]]
name = "Stickman"
identity = "text"
voice = "alnilam"

[[scenes]]
id = "scene_01"
action = "A mysterious stickman walks slowly through a dark forest."
framing = "wide"
duration = 5
characters = ["Stickman"]

[[scenes]]
id = "scene_02"
action = "Close up of the stickman looking back in shock."
framing = "close-up"
duration = 5
characters = ["Stickman"]
style_variant = "warm"
```

### Outputs

1. **Clip Files:** Individual video files saved under `<out_dir>/scene_<id>.mp4` (or other formats).
2. **State File:** A `<stem>-state.json` file recording completed operations, seeds, and metadata, allowing a run to resume without wasting credits.
3. **Handoff Manifest:** A `<stem>-handoff.json` file that projects the run's metadata and clip paths, designed for downstream assemblers.

## Recipes

### Burn through a directory of inputs

```bash
mkdir -p out
for img in ./inputs/*.png; do
  name=$(basename "$img" .png)
  gflow video i2v "$img" "Cinematic push-in" --out-dir out
done
```
PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path out | Out-Null
Get-ChildItem ./inputs/*.png | ForEach-Object {
    gflow video i2v $_.FullName "Cinematic push-in" --out-dir out
}
```
### Fan out an image prompt 4-way

```bash
gflow image t2i "variations of a minimalist fox logo" -n 4 --aspect 1:1 --out ./logos/
```

### Run two profiles concurrently

```bash
# Terminal 1
gflow image batch ./batch-a.tsv --profile work

# Terminal 2 (different profile = different Chromium context = OK)
gflow image batch ./batch-b.tsv --profile personal
```

(Same profile concurrently → the second invocation fails fast with `ProfileLockedError`, exit code 11, before any Chrome process starts. Use different profiles or wait — or set `GFLOW_CLI_LEASE_WAIT_SECONDS=N` (v0.56.0, [CONFIGURATION](CONFIGURATION.md#gflow_cli_lease_wait_seconds)) to have the second invocation poll the lease and take over as soon as the holder finishes.)

### JSON logs for piping into Loki/Datadog

```bash
GFLOW_CLI_LOG_FORMAT=json gflow image t2i "..." 2>&1 | jq .
```

> Piping stderr into `jq`? Set `GFLOW_CLI_UPDATE_CHECK=0` too — the once-a-day
> update notice (v0.56.0) is a plain-text stderr line and would break the parse
> the day a newer version publishes.

## Exit codes

Phase 4 (v0.4.0a1+) maps every `GFlowError` subclass to a stable exit code so
shell scripts can branch on the failure mode without parsing stderr.

| Code | Error class           | Meaning                                          | Remediation                                                |
|------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0`  | —                     | Success                                          | —                                                          |
| `1`  | unhandled exception   | Anything not derived from `GFlowError` — **or a deliberate CLI verdict**: `gflow auth status` exits 1 for a dead/unverifiable session | Re-run with `--verbose`; for `auth status` follow the printed hint; file a bug if it persists |
| `2`  | usage error (Click)   | Bad usage / missing arg / profile missing        | Standard CLI usage error                                   |
| `3`  | `AuthExpiredError`    | Session cookies rejected by Flow (401/403)       | `gflow auth login --profile <name>`                        |
| `4`  | `RateLimitError`      | Quota / rate limit hit, exhausted retries        | Wait + reduce `GFLOW_CLI_CONCURRENCY`                      |
| `5`  | `ContentPolicyError`  | Flow rejected the prompt (200 + empty `media[]`) | Soften prompt wording                                      |
| `6`  | `NetworkError`        | Network failure persisted across 3 attempts      | Check connectivity                                         |
| `7`  | `WireFormatError`     | Unexpected response shape — Flow API changed     | File a bug (do NOT include captured tokens or signed URLs) |
| `8`  | `AuthMissingError`    | Required auth credential is absent from profile   | `gflow auth login --profile <name>`                        |
| `9`  | `TransportTimeoutError` | Browser/API operation exceeded its timeout (incl. an i2v frame UUID not found in the media picker, #287; or a wedged submission stage — the error names the stage and your Playwright version) | Retry; raise the relevant timeout — for a frame-UUID miss verify the UUID belongs to the `--project` passed; for a `stage_stalled` abort check your Playwright is in range (see [KNOWN_ISSUES](../KNOWN_ISSUES.md)) |
| `10` | `WafRejectionError`   | Flow security layer rejected the request          | Change prompt/request and retry                            |
| `11` | `ConfigurationError`  | Local configuration or browser mode is invalid — includes `ProfileLockedError` (same-profile lease contention: another `gflow`/daemon/MCP call already owns this profile) and `ProfileEngineDowngradeError` (the profile was last written by a newer Chromium major than the bundled engine about to open it — see [AUTHENTICATION § Chromium downgrade guard](AUTHENTICATION.md#chromium-downgrade-guard)) | Fix the option/env var shown in the error; for lease contention wait, use a different `--profile`, or set `GFLOW_CLI_LEASE_WAIT_SECONDS=N` to wait bounded; upgrade gflow-cli/Playwright or re-run `gflow auth login` for a downgrade refusal |
| `12` | `AuthLoginTimeoutError` | Browser sign-in was not completed in time       | Re-run login or raise `GFLOW_CLI_AUTH_LOGIN_TIMEOUT`       |
| `13` | `SecurityError`       | Unsafe local profile or secret handling blocked   | Follow the error's safety guidance                         |
| `14` | `AuthBrowserRejectedError` | Google rejected the login browser             | `gflow auth login --browser chrome`                        |
| `15` | `BrowserSessionClosedError` | The automation browser window was closed mid-operation | Re-run; keep the browser window open until the command finishes |
| `16` | `DataStoreError`      | Local database cannot be opened, a migration failed, or the DB schema is newer than the installed gflow-cli | See below                                  |
| `17` | `ModelModeIncompatibilityError` | The chosen video model can't do the requested mode (e.g. `--model omni-flash` with `--end-frame`, or `omni-flash` for `chain` — issue #125) | omni-flash does start-frame `i2v` only: drop `--end-frame`, or use a Veo 3.1 model (`veo-lite` / `veo-fast` / `veo-quality` / `veo-lite-lp`) for first+last and for `chain` |
| `18` | `VideoModelSelectionError` | gflow could not select the requested video model in Flow's editor for an `i2v` run (model-picker option not found) | Usually transient — retry; if it persists, Flow's model-picker UI changed (report referencing #125) |
| `19` | `SceneConcatError`    | Server-side scene render/concat failed (`gflow scene --output`) | Retry; the recorded compose survives, so re-render is safe |
| `20` | `FrameExtractionError` | Could not extract the last frame for a video chain link | Check the source video downloaded intact; retry the link  |
| `21` | `ChainPartialError`   | A video chain stopped mid-way; earlier links completed | Resume from the last completed link shown in the error     |
| `22` | `UpscaleUnavailableError` | 4K upscale is gated to Flow **Ultra** accounts (HTTP 403) | Use `--scale 2k`, or upgrade the Flow plan                |
| `23` | `UiSelectorDriftError` | A Flow editor control could not be located — Google changed the frontend (issues #183, #493) — **or** a blocking announcement overlay survived dismissal, so no control below it can be clicked (probe `overlay_close_button`, #593) | Update gflow-cli; file a bug with the probe name + the diagnostics JSON / debug screenshot referenced in the error message, plus the incident bundle's `report.md` when one was written. For `overlay_close_button`: open the project once in Chrome and dismiss the announcement — the dismissal persists on your account |
| `24` | `BrowserEngineUnavailableError` | `GFLOW_CLI_BROWSER_ENGINE=patchright` but the engine is not installed | `pip install 'gflow-cli[patchright]'`, or unset `GFLOW_CLI_BROWSER_ENGINE` |
| `25` | `FlowAgentUiError`    | The profile is on Flow's Agentic UI cohort and the classic media panel is unrecoverable for this operation | Rare since v0.38.0 (#332): the mode controller reliably recovers agentic→classic, so first retry with `--ui-mode classic`; if it persists, see KNOWN_ISSUES on the agentic cohort |
| `26` | `MediaAttributionError` | Generated media could not be reliably attributed to this request (issue #281) | Re-run; a dedicated project with fewer pre-existing assets avoids the ambiguity |
| `27` | `MediaUploadRejectedError` | Flow's upload endpoint refused the input file (`uploadImage` 4xx, issue #287) | Re-encode the image (`ffmpeg -q:v 2 -map_metadata -1`), or reference the asset by its media UUID |
| `28` | `UiModeUnavailableError` | The Flow UI arm this command required (`--ui-mode`/`GFLOW_CLI_UI_MODE`; `-i` forces agentic for images; **video always requires classic** — no agentic video driver exists) couldn't be reached after a switch attempt; aborted before submitting — no credits spent (issue #299) | Retry (the cohort flaps per load); try another `--profile`; for images you can also relax `GFLOW_CLI_UI_MODE` — for video there is nothing to relax |
| `29` | `MentionIndexUnavailableError` | An `@mention` was present but the catalog source needed to resolve it (character entities or media assets) failed to load — distinct from an empty index, which is not an error | Check network connectivity (character source) or `GFLOW_CLI_DB_PATH` / filesystem permissions (media source), then retry |
| `30` | `QueueSchemaError`    | A `gflow serve`/MCP worker-queue task payload has an unrecognized `schema_version` or fails validation against the typed request DTOs | Usually means gflow-cli was downgraded after a newer version enqueued the task, or the payload was hand-edited; re-enqueue with a compatible version |
| `31` | `FlowAppError`        | Flow's web app hit a client-side exception (its error-boundary page rendered instead of the editor) — a transient Flow crash, not a gflow bug | Retry shortly; if it persists, Flow itself is degraded — wait and retry later |
| `32` | `ReferenceNotFoundError` | A referenced media NAME is not in this project's picker. Flow indexes a short auto-caption, not the generation prompt, so a prompt used as a reference name never matches | Reference the asset by its media UUID, pass a local file with `--ref`, or check what exists with `gflow data list images` |
| `33` | — (`gflow doctor` verdict) | Doctor found warn/fail findings — a successful diagnosis, not an error class | Review the report; see [`gflow doctor`](#gflow-doctor) |
| `34` | `SyncPartialError`    | `gflow data sync` failed on some projects but succeeded on others — completed writes stay committed | Retryable: re-run the same command; it resumes with what is still nameless (see [`gflow data sync`](#gflow-data-sync)) |
| `35` | `AvatarUnavailableError` | Flow's Avatar/likeness is not usable on this account — identity-verification / region gate. Raised BEFORE any submit, so nothing was spent | NOT retryable: a region verdict is the same on a re-run. Confirm the Avatar tab works in Flow's web UI; otherwise use [`gflow character`](#gflow-character) or `--ref` (see [§ Avatar availability](#avatar-availability-region-and-account-eligibility)) |
| `130`| SIGINT                | User-interrupted (Ctrl-C)                        | —                                                          |

**Exit code 16 — data store / migration error.** Fires when:

- The database file cannot be opened (filesystem permission or path issues).
- A migration fails or the migration checksum drifts from what the installed version expects.
- The database has a **newer schema** than the installed gflow-cli (i.e. you downgraded after a migration already ran).

Recovery for the "newer schema" case: upgrade gflow-cli to a version that understands the schema (`uv tool upgrade gflow-cli`), OR point `GFLOW_CLI_DB_PATH` to a different database location (a fresh path creates a new empty database automatically).

All errors emit a structured `error_raised` event (or `error_unhandled` for
exit code 1) with stable fields — `error_class`, `problem` (RFC 9457 Problem
Details), `cli_command`, `correlation_id`. Pipe stderr to a file and grep
for telemetry forensics:

```bash
GFLOW_CLI_LOG_FORMAT=json gflow video t2v "..." 2> events.jsonl
jq 'select(.event == "error_raised") | .error_class' events.jsonl
```

Branch in shell scripts — capture the exit code **before** the `if`/`case` consumes it:

```bash
gflow video i2v ./initial.png "test" --out-dir out
rc=$?
if [ "$rc" -ne 0 ]; then

  case "$rc" in
    2)   echo "Bad CLI usage (missing arg, bad flag)"; exit 1 ;;
    3)   echo "Auth expired — run: gflow auth login"; exit 1 ;;
    4|6) echo "Transient infra issue (rate limit / network) — try again later"; exit 1 ;;
    5)   echo "Content policy rejected the prompt — rewrite and retry"; exit 1 ;;
    7)   echo "Flow API shape changed — upgrade gflow-cli or file a bug"; exit 1 ;;
    8)   echo "Auth profile is missing a required credential — run: gflow auth login"; exit 1 ;;
    9|12) echo "Operation timed out — retry with a larger timeout if needed"; exit 1 ;;
    10)  echo "Flow rejected the request — adjust the prompt/request and retry"; exit 1 ;;
    11)  echo "Configuration error — fix the option or env var shown above"; exit 1 ;;
    13)  echo "Security guard blocked unsafe local state — follow the error guidance"; exit 1 ;;
    14)  echo "Google rejected the login browser — run: gflow auth login --browser chrome"; exit 1 ;;
    16)  echo "Database error — check permissions or upgrade gflow-cli"; exit 1 ;;
    130) echo "Cancelled with Ctrl-C"; exit 130 ;;
    *)   echo "Unknown failure (exit $rc)"; exit 1 ;;
  esac
fi
```

> **Why `rc=$?` first?** Inside `if ! cmd; then ...`, `$?` reflects the negation pipeline (always `0` when the `then` branch fires), not the failing command. Capturing into `rc` immediately after the call is the portable pattern across bash/zsh/dash. PowerShell uses `$LASTEXITCODE` for the same purpose.

## Programmatic use

The CLI is a thin shell over `gflow_cli.api.client.FlowApiClient`. All public methods used by the commands above are also available directly.

### Importing errors

Two module paths resolve to the same error classes. Use whichever feels natural for your codebase:

```python
from gflow_cli.errors import GFlowError, AuthExpiredError   # canonical
from gflow_cli.exceptions import GFlowError, AuthExpiredError  # standard alias
```

Both are identical objects — `gflow_cli.exceptions` is a re-export of `gflow_cli.errors`. The alias exists because many developers and tools expect the conventional `exceptions` name.

### Single-shot generation

```python
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
from gflow_cli.api.client import FlowApiClient
from gflow_cli.api.image import GenerateImageRequest, Model, Aspect
from gflow_cli.config import get_settings

async def main() -> None:
    settings = get_settings()
    profile_dir = settings.profile_subdir("default")
    async with FlowApiClient(profile_dir=profile_dir, headless=settings.headless) as client:
        req = GenerateImageRequest(prompt="a peaceful lake at dawn", model=Model.IMAGE4)
        # project_id is optional — omit it and a new project is created automatically.
        image = await client.generate_image(req=req)
        saved = await client.download_image(image, Path("lake.png"))
        print(saved)

asyncio.run(main())
```

`project_id` defaults to `None`. When omitted, `generate_image()` (and `generate_images_batch()`) call `create_project()` internally. Pass an explicit `project_id` when you want multiple generations to land in the same Flow project.

`download_image()` returns the final write location. That is a local
`pathlib.Path` by default, or a cloud-backed path when
`GFLOW_CLI_STORAGE_URI` is set; see [EXTERNAL_STORAGE.md](EXTERNAL_STORAGE.md).

### Archive / cleanup

```python
async with FlowApiClient(profile_dir=profile_dir) as client:
    project = await client.create_project(title="archive demo")
    asset = await client.upload_image(project.project_id, Path("hero.png"))
    # Each uploaded asset and each generated media item has its own workflow_id.
    await client.archive_workflow(
        workflow_id=asset.workflow_id,
        project_id=project.project_id,
    )
```

`FlowApiClient.archive_workflow(workflow_id, project_id)` issues `PATCH /v1/flowWorkflows/{id}` to soft-delete a workflow. Useful in batch scripts that spin up a project per call and want to clean up afterwards. `workflow_id` comes from any `AssetInfo` (`upload_image` return) or `VideoOperation` / `VideoStatus` / `ImageResult` (generation returns) — `ProjectInfo` itself only carries `project_id` and `title`.

### Health check (long-lived workers)

For worker processes that hold a `FlowApiClient` open across many requests, call `health_check()` before dispatching to detect a dead browser context without catching exceptions yourself:

```python
async with FlowApiClient(profile_dir=profile_dir) as client:
    while True:
        job = await queue.get()
        if not await client.health_check():
            # browser context is dead — re-enter or restart the worker
            break
        image = await client.generate_image(req=job.req)
        await handle_result(image)
```

`health_check()` returns `True` if the underlying Playwright page is alive and the current URL is on a Google domain. It returns `False` (never raises) on `TargetClosedError` or any other exception.
