# Movie — multi-scene, character-consistent films

`gflow movie` turns a single TOML manifest into a sequence of generated video
clips that share the **same characters** (face + voice) across every scene. It
is the orchestration layer on top of `gflow character` (entity creation) and
`gflow video` (R2V generation).

> Status: shipped (since v0.14.0) and evolving. The CLI surface below is
> release-stable per SemVer; alpha (`0.x`) minor versions may still extend or
> adjust it, with changes noted in the CHANGELOG.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Scaffold a manifest
gflow movie template movie.toml

# 2. Edit movie.toml (characters + scenes), then run
gflow movie run movie.toml --profile <chrome-profile>
```

`movie run` is **generate-only** by default: each scene becomes its own clip in
the output directory. Pass `--stitch` for an optional ffmpeg hard-concat preview
(no transitions — not a deliverable).

## Manifest (`movie.toml`)

```toml
schema_version = 1
title = "E2E Stickman"
project = "6ba50219-…"            # reusable Flow project id
output_dir = "./out"

[style]
look = "cinematic, shallow depth of field"
palette = "warm golden tones"
negative = "no text, no watermark"
suffix = "Black and white cinematic street photography, photorealistic, film grain."

  [style.variants.warm]
  suffix = "Warm golden-hour cinematic grade."

  [style.variants.cool]
  suffix = "Cool blue-toned cinematic grade."

[[characters]]
name = "Stickman"
identity = "entity"               # reuse a Flow CHARACTER entity across scenes
face_prompt = "Simple round stickman, black ink lines, smiley face"
voice = "alnilam"                 # voice baked into the entity at creation

[[scenes]]
id = "summit"                     # stable key — used for resume
action = "stands on a clifftop at sunset, waves at the camera"
framing = "wide"
characters = ["Stickman"]         # which characters appear (drives R2V reuse)
speaker = "Stickman"
line = "We finally made it to the top!"
aspect = "9:16"
model = "omni-flash"              # only model with a duration control (see below)
duration = 8

[[scenes]]
id = "close-up"
action = "smiles with excitement"
style_variant = "warm"            # selects [style.variants.warm]
style_suffix = "golden hour light" # appended after the variant suffix
aspect = "9:16"
duration = 6
```

> **Scene `duration` requires `model = "omni-flash"`** (issue #634). Flow renders
> a duration control for `omni-flash` alone; every Veo 3.1 model renders none, so
> a scene pairing `duration` with a Veo model is rejected at **parse time** with
> exit 11 — before any scene generates. Valid values are `4`, `6`, `8`, `10`.
>
> A scene with a `duration` and **no** `model` still parses: with no model named,
> the clip inherits Flow's sticky UI default, which gflow cannot know here and so
> cannot check. If that default is a Veo model the duration is silently not
> applied. Name `model = "omni-flash"` explicitly whenever the length matters.

On first run, characters with `identity = "entity"` are created once (image
generation — **free**, no credits) and cached. Each scene then generates a clip
that **reuses the same Flow CHARACTER entity** so the character drives every
scene from one identity.

### Style variants

The `[style]` block defines a **global visual style** applied to every scene.
For channel-format videos where the style changes across scenes (e.g. a
monochrome → warm color arc), use **named variants**:

```toml
[style]
prefix = ""           # optional, prepended before the composed scene text
suffix = "Black and white cinematic street photography, photorealistic, film grain."

  [style.variants.warm]
  suffix = "Warm golden-hour cinematic grade."

  [style.variants.cool]
  suffix = "Cool blue-toned cinematic grade."
```

Per-scene selection:

| Field | Effect |
|---|---|
| `style_variant = "warm"` | Selects `[style.variants.warm]` — its `suffix` replaces the base `suffix`. |
| `style_variant = "none"` | Opts out of all style suffixes (base + variant). Prefix is still applied. |
| *(omitted)* | Uses the base `[style]` suffix. |
| `style_suffix = "sunset light"` | Scene-specific text appended **after** the variant/base suffix. |

<a name="style-configuration-errors"></a>
### Style Configuration Errors

There are two style configuration errors that will raise a `ConfigurationError`:
* **Reserved `none` name:** Defining `[style.variants.none]` is a configuration error, so the opt-out keyword can never shadow a real variant.
* **Unknown variant name:** Specifying a `style_variant` in a scene that does not exist in `[style.variants]` (and is not `"none"`) is a configuration error.

**Composition rule** (deterministic, no LLM):

```
final_prompt = [prefix] + composed_scene_text + [variant.suffix | base.suffix] + [scene.style_suffix]
```

The applied style is recorded per clip in `<manifest>-handoff.json` as
`style_applied` (`variant`, `prefix`, `suffix`, `scene_suffix`), so downstream
tools (Remotion, editors) can introspect it.

**Resume:** each completed scene's state records a hash of its composed
prompt. If you edit the style (or anything else that changes a scene's
prompt) and re-run, only the affected scenes are regenerated — unchanged
scenes are still skipped and cost no credits. State files written by older
gflow-cli versions fall back to comparing the stored prompt text; scenes with
no stored prompt are never re-run automatically.

> **Consistency is best-effort, not pixel-exact.** gflow guarantees the *right
> entity rides the wire* (`consistency_method = entity`); the final on-screen
> fidelity is Flow's Veo R2V model, which may reinterpret minimalist or
> hand-drawn references (e.g. a single round body can render as stacked
> circles). For tighter results, use clearer/richer reference images and a
> higher-tier model (`veo-quality`/`veo-fast` rather than `veo-lite`) — the same
> trade-offs you would hit driving Flow's UI by hand.

## Run lifecycle — keep the browser open

`gflow movie run` drives the **real Flow web UI** in a headed Chrome window
(your `--browser chrome` profile). For **each scene** the same browser window
is used end-to-end:

1. **Attach** the character entity to the generation (see below).
2. **Submit** the prompt — this passes reCAPTCHA and **spends 1 video credit**.
3. **Poll** Flow for completion (the clip renders server-side, ~30–90s).
4. **Download** the finished mp4 into `output_dir`.

> **Do not close the browser window while a run is in progress.** Steps 3 and 4
> still use the browser page (polling even brings it to the foreground). If the
> window is closed before a scene finishes downloading, the in-flight scene
> **aborts** — you will see a "Target/page/context closed" or `scene_failed`
> error. **This is expected, not a bug.**

If a run is interrupted (closed window, crash, network drop), it is **safe to
re-run**: the sibling `<manifest>-state.json` records completed scenes (keyed on
`scene.id`) and they are skipped, so the command resumes where it left off. A
versioned handoff manifest (`<manifest>-handoff.json`) is always written at the
end.

> **Future — fire-and-forget.** Flow's status-poll and download endpoints are
> non-generative and *could* be driven browser-free over Bearer REST (no
> reCAPTCHA, no extra credits), letting the browser close right after submit
> while gflow finishes over the API. That mode is **not implemented yet**; today
> the browser is required for the full generate → poll → download cycle.

## Character consistency (how the entity rides)

A scene listing `characters = ["Stickman"]` is generated as **R2V**
(reference-to-video) so the named Flow CHARACTER entity is reused. The entity is
attached by driving Flow's resource picker:

1. Click **Add Media** in the composer (references sub-mode).
2. Switch to the **Personagens** (Characters) tab.
3. **Right-click** the entity tile — addressed by entity id as
   `data-tile-id="fe_id_<entityId>"` — and choose the **include-in-prompt**
   action from the context menu (the `add`-ligature menu item; its caption is
   localized per account language, e.g. "Incluir no comando" on pt-BR or
   "Добавить в запрос" on ru — selectors are locale-free since issue #170).
   *(A plain left-click navigates into the character editor; the inline include
   button on the **Tudo** tab attaches the character's thumbnail as a plain
   image, not the entity.)*

This puts `referenceEntities:[{entityId}]` on the
`video:batchAsyncGenerateVideoReferenceImages` **request**. Flow's **response**
echoes the accepted entity at:

```
media[].mediaMetadata.requestData.videoGenerationRequestData
      .videoGenerationEntityInputs[].entityId
```

gflow asserts this on every entity scene (`_assert_entities_attached`) and
**refuses to report success** if the entity did not ride — a text/image-only
clip is never silently passed off as character-consistent. The recorded
`consistency_method` in the run state is `entity` when the entity rode (vs
`text`).

See [CHARACTER.md](CHARACTER.md) for the underlying entity model and
[CHARACTER_RECON.md](CHARACTER_RECON.md) for the reverse-engineered wire
protocol.

## Scene instructions (project brief cards)

You can manage a project's Agent-Mode brief cards per-scene. The movie manifest supports both global and scene-level instructions blocks:

```toml
[instructions]
# Applied to all scenes unless overridden.
[[instructions.card]]
title = "Cinematic Lighting"
text  = "Volumetric cinematic light from camera-left"
ref   = ["./refs/mood.jpg"]
enabled = true

[[scenes]]
id = "scene-1"
action = "hero emerges from fog"
[scenes.instructions]
disable = ["Cinematic Lighting"]  # disable a global card for this scene
[[scenes.instructions.card]]
title = "Fog Atmosphere"
text  = "Dense volumetric fog, low contrast"
```

For each scene, `gflow movie` merges global manifest cards with scene overrides (applying `disable` lists and adding/overriding `card` definitions), fetches the current project brief from the Flow server, uploads any local reference images to generate media UUIDs, preserves existing card IDs to prevent state drift, and `PATCH`es the brief to set the master switch and update cards before generating that scene's clip. See [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md) for the project-level instructions surface.

> **The manifest is authoritative — this is a full-sync, like `gflow instructions apply`.** The `PATCH` **replaces** the project's brief with exactly the manifest's card set, so any card added out-of-band in the Flow web UI that is not in `movie.toml` is **removed** when a scene runs. Keep every card you want in the brief under `[instructions]` / `[scenes.instructions]`. Consecutive scenes that resolve to the same card set are synced only once per run (no redundant re-upload / `PATCH`).

## `movie run` options

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `--profile <name>` | default profile | Chrome profile to drive (must be a `chrome`-strategy profile). |
| `--out-dir <dir>` | manifest `output_dir` | Override the output directory. |
| `--dry-run` | off | Print the pending video operation plan; make **no** API calls. |
| `--fail-fast` / `--continue-on-error` | continue | Stop on the first scene failure, or attempt the rest (default). |
| `--stitch` | off | After generating, hard-concat all clips into one preview mp4 (ffmpeg, no transitions). |

## Credits

- Character creation (image generation) is **free** — no credits, no reCAPTCHA.
- Each **scene** is one pending video generation operation, submitted at step 2
  above. Current credit use varies by model, duration, account tier, and Flow
  policy — check Google Flow before submitting. An accepted operation may
  consume credits even if later polling or download fails. A `--dry-run` prints
  the plan without submitting anything.
