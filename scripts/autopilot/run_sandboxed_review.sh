# The council memory mount target is not arbitrary: SKILL.md D5 tells the
# reviewer to inspect ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory, and $HOME in the image
# is /home/nonroot. It was /memory until 2026-08-18, so the reviewer read a
# path that did not exist and the council ran with no memory at all while the
# mount looked perfectly healthy from the host.
# --add-dir is the other half: the tree sits outside the /workspace cwd, so
# without it the agent is permission-denied and reports no memory at all.
# It must follow the positional prompt -- it is variadic and swallows it.
# COUNCIL_TOOLS: in -p mode a permission prompt is an auto-deny, not a pause --
# every `gh` call came back "This command requires approval" and the reviewer
# halted to ask a question nobody reads. The gate still has to go, but only for
# the reads the protocol actually makes.
#
# Deliberately NOT --dangerously-skip-permissions. That would also unlock Write,
# Edit and arbitrary Bash, and the permission gate is the only technical
# enforcement of SKILL.md section 9's no-write-tools rule. The container bounds a
# different threat (host and repo compromise) than that rule does: the agent
# ingests PR diffs and comments an external contributor controls, so an
# unrestricted tool surface in here is a confused-deputy path, not a sandbox
# escape. Raised by the council reviewing PR #557 against itself.
#
# The list is enumerated from SKILL.md's own invocations, read-only subcommands
# only. Deliberately absent: gh pr merge/review/ready/comment/close and gh auth
# login, git push/stash/tag/worktree/branch. The host posts the review comment
# with the write-scoped token; the container's PAT 403s on POST regardless.
#
# Widen only with evidence: a missing entry shows up as the reviewer stalling on
# a denied tool (`gh auth status` was the first, found by running it), never as
# a wrong verdict.
